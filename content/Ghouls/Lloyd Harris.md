Monsters exist. [[Harrison Baker]] was one of them. Lloyd thought that Bronte and Amos were as well, but they let Lloyd out of the basement and the three of them killed [[Harrison Baker]]. Now Lloyd is running with Bronte. Bronte who won't stop apologizing. Bronte who wakes screaming from nightmares. Lloyd was with him for convenience, but now he's not sure if he can leave him.
