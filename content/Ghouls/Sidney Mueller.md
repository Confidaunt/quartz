Previously the ghoul of [[Leonardo Dupont]]. Sidney has long been valued by Leon for her knowledge of blood sorcery and her ability to keep an ordered house. She was never permitted anything outside of her station. Free of the bond she wants so much. She deserves so much and she's going to take it.
