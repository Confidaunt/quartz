[[Saveria Di Traglia]] was the only thing keeping him on the straight and narrow. He was her student during high school in the late 30's. He was also the only one that came back from his graduating class. He held on for a few years and when he tried to end it, Saveria was there. She took him. He's never been okay since returning. When the blood bond break, he's back in the worst parts of his life.
