The four of them were friends once. Everything was fine, it had been for centuries, but then August said he was leaving. Leaving all of them. Marianne couldn't accept that. She said no. She tried to stop August and he ripped her apart. August forced Emile and Hannah not to act, to only be witnesses. His last words to the two of them were "We part for the last time as friends. Seek me only if you want death."

Emile is mourning the four of them. He accepts directions from Hannah, but mostly just stays still, waiting for instructions that will never come again.
