Like [[Nicholas Wolf]], he stood by and watched [[Nadine Donell]] be diablerized. Benji wanted strength at his back, and the Camarilla wouldn't care about the ghoul of some no name female Tremere. He sided with [[The Blooded]] fully and keeps in contact with Nicholas.
A freed ghoul taken in by Nadine.
