All he ever was to [[Harrison Baker]] was a toy to play with. Harrison made him hurt, took his life, and showed him so many terrible things. He made him do terrible things. Bronte freed [[Lloyd Harris]], but Lloyd was only the latest in a long line. Killing him was a mistake in that there was so much more that could be done. He's not going to be a servant any longer. He'll find his own power.
