Niall enjoyed being [[Enzo Farr]]'s muscle. He could match up against any other ghoul and hold his own. He was even good enough to cause issues for young kindred. He wasn't strong enough to pull Enzo off of Evie. He wasn't strong enough to hold onto Enzo when he threw him across the room. He wasn't fast enough to catch up to Enzo as he fled the haven and into the night. 

There are plenty of things that Niall is strong enough for, vengeance especially.
