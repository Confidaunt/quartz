Previously a ghoul of [[Fatima Blake]]. Look, Fatima was a blessing when they met. The woman pulled some strings and got her out of jail after Stanna shot her grandson dead for abusing his wife. The boy had been given enough warnings. Unfortunately she wasn't able to enact any sort of retribution on the Tremere that they so rightly deserved. She and Jalynne aren't going to take freedom lying down.
