Previously the ghoul of [[Enzo Farr]]. Fay liked Enzo. He was always a lot, but he let her wander and dabble and do mostly as she pleased. He asked things of her on occasion, but it was rarely enough to ever truly be a hassle. She had the right numbers to call and the right people to ask for favors. Fay is a good listener. Rumors and something she was good at hearing. 

It's not a rumor that Leon drove Enzo to hurt Evie, Fay knows it's the truth in her heart. And it's her heart that breaks when she feels Enzo die. She and Niall flee into the daylight vowing revenge on both Leon and whomever killed Enzo.
