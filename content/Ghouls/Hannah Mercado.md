The four of them were friends once. Everything was fine, it had been for centuries, but then August said he was leaving. Leaving all of them. Marianne couldn't accept that. She said no. She tried to stop August and he ripped her apart. August forced Emile and Hannah not to act, to only be witnesses. His last words to the two of them were "We part for the last time as friends. Seek me only if you want death."

Her first free breaths in centuries were screaming. Screaming at Marianna to stop, to leave August be. Marianna didn't listen. Everything is ruined. Everything is in tatters. Emile is with her still, but he alone was never enough. It's up to her to find safety. She's not going to find it with Camarilla. They'll have no love for a traitorous Chancellor or his leavings.
