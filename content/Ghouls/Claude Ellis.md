Claude Ellis prefers Ellis. It provides more ambiguity. It allows them to slip into any roll that Master Tovar might need. Typically they are overwatch during any night missions, but they are talented enough to strike during the day by themselves. They were a gift to Son Tovar from Elijah after Son Tovar was broken.
