Jalynne was an old woman when [[Fatima Blake]] embraced her. She's only 10 years younger than Fatima. The treatment of women by supernatural forces leave a lot to be desired. Jalynne isn't interested in re-entering a contract where she will have such a low status for something that doesn't matter. She and Stanna leave to seek out greener pastures with the Anarchs in St. Paul.
