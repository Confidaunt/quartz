Mark Decker prefers hunting Lupines to ruling Milwaukee. He uses the position to protect the city, placing his Anubi in top-ranking jobs and strictly enforcing the Masquerade. In recent nights, he’s grown even more suspicious of the Kindred in his territory — who’s plotting against him? Who’s undermining his agenda? Breaking his strict new laws results in swift punishment, up to and including the final death. He trusts very few people outside of his inner circle, and even those he watches warily. After all, he was unprepared both for Carna’s exodus from Milwaukee and his clan’s defection from the Camarilla. Who else, he wonders, is ready to turn on him? On occasion, he reaches out to Inyanga in Chicago to seek an outside perspective on local matters. These nights, those communications are fewer and longer between. Decker keeps his city on constant high alert against werewolves and Anarchs, and respects those Kindred who display the same vigilance he does. Perhaps some night, if he can push the Lupines back far enough and strike a massive blow to the Anarchs, he’d consider relinquishing his throne. But that’s a long, long way off, and there’s much work to be done before then. LORE

• Good Graces: Decker has put a small amount of trust in you, assigning you to patrol duty around the city and allowing you to act with his authority in minor breaches of his laws. Still, he requires you to enter a one-step Blood Bond in case that feeling is misplaced.

•• Foe to Werewolves: Decker is aware of the body count you’ve racked up protecting Milwaukee. He grants you feeding rights to a small rack, providing you with a two-dot Herd and a one-dot Haven.

••• One Strike: Your penchant for not only upholding but enforcing the Prince’s laws has caused Decker to loosen his reins on you. It’s still unwise to break them, but once per story he allows you to plead your case if you’re caught for a minor infraction. Rather than the final death, he’ll impose sanctions.

•••• The Prince’s Trust: You’ve fought at Decker’s side against the Lupines and rooted out Anarch incursions. You’ve learned how to talk to him without setting him off, or at least how to push those buttons without turning his suspicions on yourself. Decker listens to your counsel, and his trust in you gives you a little leeway in the city. Gain Mark Decker as a five-dot Mawla once per story. Additionally, once per story, you may dine with him at the Hyatt or join him in his private suite at Brewers Stadium for an audience.

••••• Childe of Mark Decker (Gangrel Only): Decker granted you the gift of his Embrace and expects you to treat such an honor accordingly. He’s trained you as one of his Anubi and placed you in a position of power in the city. Work with your Storyteller to determine where your authority lies. Decker provides you with a three-dot Haven, and you gain one free Skill Specialty in Athletics, Brawl, or Melee.
