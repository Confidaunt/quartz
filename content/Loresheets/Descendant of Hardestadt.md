To hear many Ventrue tell it, Hardestadt was the most important Ventrue for eight centuries, until his destruction by Brujah rebels led by the betrayer Theo Bell during the Convention of Prague in 2012. Hardestadt was the Ventrue founder of the Camarilla, alongside six peers from other clans, and Ventrue credit him with the sect’s strength and survival since then. Hardestadt did not Embrace many mortals, and oddly for a Ventrue, he never confirmed his lineage back to a Fourth Generation methuselah. As far as Hardestadt was concerned, he was the be-all and end-all of the Ventrue. None who came before or after could hold a candle to his achievements. 

• Voice of Hardestadt: Hardestadt shouted often, punctuating his remarks with fist blows to tables, walls, or unfortunate ghouls. Your Blood allows you to speak over any noise and draw attention, whether in a buzzing meeting room or at a rave. Something in your voice allows others to hear you. Whether they go on to pay attention depends on what you say. 

•• Supreme Leader: Hardestadt’s self-confidence as a leader was in many ways his undoing, but until his Final Death, it saw him rise to greatness. You can convince others to follow you into deadly situations or command from the rear, and you can send subjects to their doom to better your position. Once per story, you suffer no penalty to your dice pool for sending people into danger. 

••• Ventrue Pillar: Due to your prestigious lineage, other Ventrue look to you for guidance. Regardless of your Status with other groups, you always have three dots of Status (•••) with Ventrue. 

•••• Line to the Founders: Hardestadt ensured his entire line could reach him when endangered. He rarely answered communications unless the situation was dire, and he punished misuse severely, but his method still holds despite his death. Once per chronicle, you can call, write to, or arrange a meeting with one of the Camarilla’s founders in lieu of Hardestadt. Whether they deign to respond depends upon the importance of your request.

••••• Hardestadt’s Heir: You hold in your possession a signed document in which Hardestadt names you as his successor. You’re not sure what you are a successor to: mere wealth and power, Ventrue kingship, or even the Inner Circle of the Camarilla. When you take the name of “Hardestadt,” the document claims that the Camarilla shall march to the beat of your drum – and ensures that the Anarchs will swarm to take you down.
