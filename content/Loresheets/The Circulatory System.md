The exploration of blood and its Resonances has spawned rings of Kindred eager for knowledge, power, and profit. The international human trafficking network known as the Circulatory System smuggle important vessels between domains and chronicle the powers of the blood vintages they move. The Circulatory System care little for the long-term well-being of their vessels, beyond the dip in profits they suffer when such kine die prematurely. Many Kindred can look past such minor issues to the pioneering studies the System makes possible by unlocking new and valuable features of the Blood. Your relationship with the Circulatory System may be as a trafficker, a client, or even as a former mortal vessel turned vampire. You may detest the faction’s exploitative practices or see their potential and crave a taste of their operations. 

• Tap into the System: Once per story, you can request specific blood vessels from the Circulatory System to convey certain abilities – or to provide for a Ventrue who finds their feeding preference neglected in the domain. 

•• Little Black Book: You have come into the possession of one of the System’s little black books. These books contain records of blood experiments and theories on the power of select vessels’ blood. The Storyteller determines the book’s accuracy on specific matters; in general, it adds one die to Investigation, Alchemy, Medicine, or Science tests to track down or test a specific vintage. It also cuts the time to research a new two-dot or three-dot thin-blood Alchemy formula in half. 

••• Farm Upstate: You know where the System keeps a farm of valuable vessels: mortals with blood potent enough to convey benefits to Kindred drinkers. You can raid the farm, lease specific vessels at cost, or try to muscle your way in. These vessels are equivalent to four dots of Herd, but you can only feed from them once per week unless you overtly take over the farm. 

•••• Secure Transit: The Circulatory System uses armored vans and armed ghoul drivers to transport vessels from A to B. These protected modes of transit are more than simple security vans; they bristle with weapons and sometimes contain incredibly valuable vessels destined for important buyers. You have access to one of these vans. Whether you’re riding up front as a legitimate driver or have successfully hijacked one of these vans, you may arrange secure travel for one or more Kindred with little effort. 

••••• Blood Sommelier: You know the Circulatory System’s secret methods for taste, analysis, and refinement, and you can replicate them. Perhaps you own a blood laboratory, have an alchemist or blood sorcerer on call, or you just stay au courant on aficionado gossip. You can add two dice to any test to discover the Resonance of blood, and you can select three dots of Contacts, Allies, or Haven Merits to explain your knowledge. Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller the properties of the most valuable vessel’s blood.
