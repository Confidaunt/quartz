All of Clan Nosferatu knows their great architect Zelios as a master planner, mason, and scholar of geomantic power. Though he disappeared beneath New York in the 1990s, he left behind libraries of books, plans, and treatises on the power of location and sacred geometry. Zelios’ descendants continue his good work, instructing other vampires on the building of havens, dungeons, prisons, and labyrinths. They can supposedly sense ley lines and, for a price, advise Princes where to locate havens at these epicenters to ensure both armor and power from the earth and stars. 

• Sanctuary: Your haven is a wonder of modern design, possessing security in the form of secret passages, electronic security, and even a self-destruct button, all while looking stylish and comfortable. Split two dots between either or both of the Haven Merits Postern and Security System, but someone, somewhere likely has all the details of the setup. 

•• Saboteur: You instinctively know where a building’s weaknesses are, and you don’t even require explosives to destroy it. With maul, crowbar, cable, and cold chisel, and as many nights on site as the difficulty the Storyteller sets for the building (i.e. four for a family home, six for a bank, eight for a prison, nine for a skyscraper), you can collapse an edifice like a house of cards. On 

••• Commission: Other vampires know you descend from Zelios and ask for advice on how best to build their own havens. This business ensures you often have a boon or two to collect (roughly one minor boon per story) and that you know where a number of powerful vampires sleep – which, in the end, probably does you more harm than good. 

•••• The Labyrinth: You used Zelios’ work to construct a labyrinth beneath your domain, made in part with sewers, disused drains, cellars, basements, and maintenance tunnels. You added your own chambers, dead ends, and connections to form a true underground maze. Only those you tell know of your labyrinth. You cannot treat the labyrinth as a Haven, as it terrifies you, but if you reach it when chased, no one can pursue you. 

••••• Sense the Ley Lines: You occasionally glimpse throbbing red tendrils snaking through the earth: ley lines. Vampires who make their havens where these vessels converge find their Hunger grows more slowly (when making a Rouse check for awakening, roll two dice and pick the highest) if they sleep there by day. Ley lines have other powerful magical effects – secrets you can research along lines the Storyteller indicates – and your fellow Sewer Rats harshly punish disclosing anything about such secrets.
