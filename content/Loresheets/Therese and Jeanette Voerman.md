Since its revival, Chicago’s Succubus Club has had only one rival for nightclub of the dead: The Asylum in Los Angeles. The Voerman sisters run the joint, or joints, as the Asylum franchise now appears in regnae across America, Asia, and Europe. Famous for both their enterprising natures and combative personalities, the Voermans loathe each other despite their success. In L.A., to “do a Voerman” is to make a member of your own coterie a sworn enemy. Therese and Jeanette now run separate Asylums, one in Santa Monica, another in Hollywood. They never appear in the same club. Only the Malkavians closest to the Voermans know that Therese and Jeanette are one vampire: two distinct personalities sharing the same body. Some say she bore this condition as a mortal, while others claim there were two sisters, but one killed the other. Other rumors whisper about another sister, who acts as an imprisoned thrall to the Malkavian. Highly volatile, the Voermans prove that Malkavians can be as inspired and prosperous as any Toreador or Ventrue, but many Anarchs anticipate the moment that Therese and Jeanette go to war with each other.  

• Asylum Membership: You never need to wait in a queue for entry to the Asylum, you always have one of the best seats in the house, and as long as you don’t fuck up, you may hunt there once or twice per session (Difficulty 2) without any ruffled feathers. 

•• Performing Monkey: Jeanette and Therese know you as a reliable asset, and they frequently subject you to missions ranging from serious investigations to flights of insane fancy. Although dangerous, they are generous, and they repay any boons incurred. 

••• Jeanette’s Favorite: Jeanette Voerman, the wild child of the Voerman family, adores you, pets you, and flirts with you. Though she arguably is the less stable of the sisters, she’s also the more generous one. You may stay in the day chamber of any Asylum club if you require (if Jeanette is there, she insists you do), use the club to host your own parties, and ask for favors small and large from the Anarch Baron. Jeanette counts as a four-dot Mawla, but only for the purposes of Malkavian and Anarch dealings. 

•••• Therese’s Favorite: Therese Voerman, the upright, strict member of the Voerman family, respects and values you. Her business-oriented mind does not allow her to expend the Asylum’s resources on your luxury, but she speaks up for you in any regnum where an Asylum is present, and can school you in business and finance if you require it. She counts as a three-dot Mawla. Asylum 

••••• Operator: Jeanette or Therese permit you to franchise an Asylum club in your domain. As long as the club remains open, you have four dots to spend on Haven, Herd, Resources, or the Chasse of your Domain; depending on your club’s focus, which may be changed over time. Whether the club is an Elysium is up to you.
