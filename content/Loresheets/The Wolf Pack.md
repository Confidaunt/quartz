Wind whips through their hair as the Wolf Pack stalks the lonely roads and cities of southern Illinois. They strike quickly, their presence marked by the roar of engines and wild laughter, leaving only vanishing pavement and broken Anarchs in their wake. The Wolf Pack has served the Camarilla for decades, rebels for a cause that reject their clan’s abandonment of the Ivory Tower to bend rules and crack heads in service of the Traditions. The Wolf Pack roams far and wide in their role as roving Archons, but are short a few members after the brutal War of Chicago against the Lupines. Maybe you met them on the open highway and rode with them a spell? Maybe they saw something in you and decided to make you a prospect? Whatever your interaction, it probably made you a little bit stronger, and a whole lot meaner. LORE

• Prospect: Surviving Tyrus’ “initiation” into the Wolf Pack requires a certain degree of resilience. Reduce the difficulty of all Survival rolls related to travel and outdoorsmanship by one.

•• Member: Rule one of joining the Wolf Pack is that you have to be able to ride. Your association with the Pack grants you a twodie bonus to all Drive tests while riding a motorcycle.

••• White Line Nightmare: The Wolf Pack lives frugally, but spares no expense on its bikes. Once per game, you can call on the Wolf Pack’s contacts in the motorcycle community across the country to obtain immediate access to a custom motorcycle.

•••• Dread Riders: Your association with Anthius gives you access to a veritable army of Midwestern motorcycle gangs. Once per chronicle, you can call on Anthius’ influence to assemble hundreds of Hell’s Angels anywhere in the continental United States within three nights (although the first groups arrive within hours). These bikers provide you with a five-dot Ally group that can be roughly directed toward a single objective of your choosing. Be forewarned the potential for massive collateral damage and government involvement are high.

••••• Gives no…: Tyrus infuses you with a measure of his hard-headed, hard-hearted, and hard-riding personality. You never take anything from anybody and are willing to stare down Caine himself if he has the balls to challenge you. Once per session, you can ignore even the most formidable attempt to intimidate you. You become immune to any single attempt to intimidate, cow, or make you back down or retreat (mundane or supernatural). This ability disappears at the start of the next scene.
