Rafael DeLuna was a pathologist working for the Medical Examiner's office in downtown Minneapolis when tragedy befell his family and changed his life forever. In the winter of 2010, conditions in the Midwest proved particularly lethal as dozens of homeless in the Twin Cities died of exposure due to the extreme cold. Of the many dead bodies unclaimed by friends or family, one turned out to the body of a freshly embraced fledgling who, in their frenzy, murdered DeLuna's wife.

That night, upon his horrific awakening to the dark truth of the world, Rafael was consumed with a singular purpose: all vampires must die. Rafael's fellow survivors were quick to join his cause, and from there, his influence grew throughout the Midwest. Little by little, small-time hunter cells began to coordinate their tactics with one another, until several pockets of previously independent units grew into a vampire-hunting network known (perhaps erroneously) as "The Mortician's Army."

• Mortician's Hammer: Though their means and methods may be as varied as the individual members of the Army themselves, all of the Mortician's soldiers carry this unique item with them. Half weapon, half calling-card, members of the Mortician's Army carry these hammer-hook hybrids to recognize one another and, in a pinch, to slay Kindred. Whether through sheer coincidence, or as a spoil of war, you've managed to procure one of these instruments. The Mortician's Hammer counts as a +2 Heavy bludgeoning or piercing weapon, depending upon how it is used. Also, carrying it will automatically grant you a -1 Difficulty on all interaction with member of the Mortician's Army, provided they do not know you are Kindred. 

•• Marked For Death: You have tangled with the Mortician's Army before and have managed to come out ahead. While the Mortician's Army may never forgive you, you never forget and have come to adapt against their methods, attacks, and techniques. You gain the Enemy ( ) flaw. However, you may gain a +1 die bonus on all contested rolls made against the hunters of the Mortician's Army.

••• Eyes-On: You have sniffed out the presence of the Mortician's Army within your domain and have been able to keep a consistent eye on their movements and tactics. Once per story, you may ask the storyteller if any of your surveillance suggests an impending attack on a vampire within your city. Whether you choose to warn them or not is up to you.

•••• The Sleeper Agent: In life, you served as a solider in The Mortician's Army. In undeath, you continue to server their agenda as a spy within the Kindred community. You gain four dots to be spent within the Allies or Contacts representing your affiliation with the mortal hunters. You also gain the Dark Secret Flaw ( ) relating to your involvement in the Army. Once per story, you may call upon the full support of the Mortician's Army to bear against your enemies, though doing so will forever reveal your true identity. 

••••• The Unseen: You are one of the few who has betrayed their kind and embraced a mortal hunter. Whether in a calculated move in a long game against those who have slighted you or something committed under duress, you now have learned how to deftly manipulate your childe and their network of contacts. You gain a one-rank Mawla to represent your new progeny and Allies (    ) representing a faction of the Mortician's Army that you have bent, perhaps unknowingly, to your undead will. You gain the flaw Dark Secret ( ) as your secret childe is likely a punishable offense in most domains, and the truth about them is likely even more forbidden.
