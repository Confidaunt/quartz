You know what lit the fires of the First Inquisition that raged from the Middle Ages through to the Renaissance. Perhaps an ancestor spoke in fear of those nights. Maybe you own texts chronicling those terrible times or you have designs on recreating them by turning the church against your enemies. Your knowledge of the Inquisition is such that you may have capacity to manipulate the Second Inquisition of tonight, though their methods and some beliefs have changed. You know how best to evade the group and how to turn them against your foes. Such actions do not come without risk, just as your ancestors who attempted the same feat discovered. 

• Mistakes of the Past: You know Kindred history and can cite chapter and verse of the domains and Princes the Inquisition destroyed in its original incarnation. You can educate any vampire on the Inquisition’s historic dangers. Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller for one piece of information regarding the original Inquisition. 

•• Names of the Guilty: Your knowledge of vampire and Inquisition relations extends to include Kindred manipulators. Though most are dead by these nights, many of their descendants survive, and they are at risk of blackmail for their sires’ treacheries. Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller for the name of one descendant of these traitors in your domain, if there is one. 

••• The Sect of St. James: You have contacts who consider themselves “old Inquisitors.” The Sectus Sancti Iacomi harbors a deep resentment for their fancy modern counterparts, acting with greater fanaticism and suicidal zeal than the more controlled Second Inquisition. Their abbé is a four-dot Contact, whom you can contact once per story. 

•••• The Second Act: You have a Contact within the Second Inquisition or the local Catholic archdiocese: a file clerk, scout hunter, exorcist, armorer, etc. You have no power over them, but you know how to pump them for information – or prime them with disinformation – if need be. 

••••• Black Spot: You have identified a location within your domain that the Second Inquisition fears to tread. Once per story, if you or anyone targeted by the Second Inquisition hides out at this location, the hunters call off the search. This anomaly seems to be a blessing, but it does throw up the question: What is so holy or unholy about this place that it deters the greatest threat to Kindred tonight?
