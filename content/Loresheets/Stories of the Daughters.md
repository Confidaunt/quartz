Not many young Kindred have heard of the Daugh- ters of Cacophony, but stories of undead singers ex- traordinaire are occasionally told in Elysia by those who claim to have met one. A rumored bloodline (although rumormongers cannot agree whether of clan Malkavian, Toreador, or another), the legendary sirens can allegedly sway and hurt using their voice alone, capable of shattering much more than glass. Any appearance of a particularly vocally talented Kindred (of any gender, as “Daughters” is but a title) in the domain may spark gossip, and a few Kindred fear the legends enough to act preemp- tively on such news, turning rumor into danger for the alleged Siren. Some do not believe in Daughters’ existence, while others success- fully pretend to be one, despite their sires knowing nothing of such connection.  

• Aspiring Idol: Perhaps you trained your voice daily before your Embrace, and find the nightly routine a practice that helps you maintain some connection to your mortal past, or maybe you’re just naturally gifted with a pleasant voice and you like the sound of it. Receive two additional dice to any roll involving singing, but if you fail, suffer an immediate Compulsion for the shame you brought on yourself. 

•• Surprise Performance: The talent lies dormant within you, and comes to light in the most unexpected moments. Once per story, receive two extra successes on a roll involving public speaking. This can be done after the roll has been made, and can be paired with using Presence. 

••• Wayward Daughter: You’ve heard about Daughters of Cacophony, and whatever you’ve heard, you turned into your identity. You successfully (so far) pretend to be a Daughter in the domain you reside in. You’ve also convinced the local Kindred society to treat you like a big deal (though some individuals may argue). This comes with benefits — receive four dots to distribute among Status, Herd and Mawla. However, someone - like your sire — knows your secret, and might use it against you if you give them a reason. Once that happens, lose your gained advantages and gain Flaw: Suspect among the faction you're the most acquainted with. 

•••• Songstress Supreme: Maybe the vitae of the Daughters re- ally does flow in your undead veins, or maybe you’re just exceptionally talented. Regardless of the source, the beauty and power of your voice surpasses most mortal singers. Gain four additional dice to any vocal performances, but your talent has earned you some unwanted “fans.” Gain the Stalkers Flaw, and a single powerful Adversary who feels either jealous or possessive of you. 

••••• Rejuvenating Voice: Your voice is almost supernaturally soothing. Gain two additional dice to your non-intimidation Presence rolls, as well as while using Quell the Beast or Obeah. Additionally, once per story, you can restore three levels of Superficial Willpower damage to everyone capable of hearing your voice. This performance must last for one scene. If interrupted, all listeners suffer one point of Superficial Willpower damage.
