Vampire adherents of the Path of Lilith, otherwise known as the Lilin, Lilitu, or Bahari, revere the progenitor vampire as primal femininity. They believe Lilith is the first, usurped vampire, the mother who births the vitae, and that all Kindred are her children. Stagnant, patriarchal vampire society perpetuates the lie of Caine as progenitor. The Bahari seek enlightenment through pain and conflict, turning this masochistic urge into the strength to endure and overcome. As Lilith rebelled against God’s commands and fought against her curse, her followers defeat the weaknesses and curses upon them to become something else. Some Bahari lead other Kindred to enlightenment, others become perfected predators. Bahari deprecate compassion in favor of fleshly pleasure, transient love, and strict parenthood over lesser Kindred. As a Bahari, you fulfill the role of torturer, student, teacher, or lover to other Kindred. All evidence you have seen points to Lilith as the first, usurped vampire. Or perhaps you secretly adhere to the Church of Caine and gnaw at the Bahari from inside out. 

• Dangerous Reputation: Bahari intimidate vampires not of their order. Vampire believers in the Cainite mythos feel uncomfortable in your presence. Once per story, you may add two dice to Intimidation pools in tests against Caine-worshipers, assuming they know of your allegiance. 

•• Ritual Scarification: You know pain leads to enlightenment. Specifically, the Lilitu preach that bringing one’s physical shell to the extremes of sensation grants greater insight. Once per session, you may scar yourself with one point of Aggravated damage to recover a level of Willpower damage: superficial or Aggravated. 

••• Sacrifice the Children: The Bahari believe both in siring childer and sacrifice. Faithful Bahari know the ultimate sacrifice is the murder of their own childe. If you diablerize your childe, you gain three extra dice in your Humanity + Blood Potency dice pool to absorb Disciplines (see Diablerie, p. 234). 

•••• The Womb’s Blood: Bahari consider fertility and sex sources of strength, with some factions placing special prominence on blood or vitae taken from the womb. Once per story, after drinking blood from the uterus, you receive an additional two dots in either Stamina or Resolve (thus increasing Health or Willpower by two) until the dawn. 

••••• First-Cursed: Lilith’s worshipers maintain that she was the first living being cursed by God, before Adam, Eve, or Caine. The Bahari strive to emulate Lilith’s lesser curse, and in so doing find their Cainite weaknesses lessened. You retain your clan bane, but you can now walk in the first hour of daylight and final hour of dusk; you can also engage in intercourse without Rousing the Blood. However, you radiate danger: the equivalent of the Obvious Predator ( ) Flaw. All Social tests to ostracize or slander you have their Difficulty reduced by one. Finally, any vampire assessing you with Auspex immediately suffers migraine-like headaches; their Resolve and Willpower drop by half your Resolve (rounded up) for one scene.
