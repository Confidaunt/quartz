Some claim she dwells in the Americas, constantly at war with a rival. Others say she runs the most popular vampire nightclub in the world. A few believe she is the clan founder’s lover, and that she is in the process of waking the Toreador Antediluvian. Beautiful and gifted, it is said none can look away from Helena unless she wills it. Mortals have died to be the first to witness her artistic creations. Her descendants all display an immense level of talent, exemplifying the traditional Toreador role. It is a stereotype few Toreador resent; Helena is a clan icon. Toreador want to get to know you, so they can get a little closer to her. 

• Skin-Deep: No matter your standing, dropping Helena’s name in conversation with a Toreador or a vampire who knows of her effectively raises your Status by one dot. You can drop Helena’s name once per story for this effect, or more often to make everyone sick of you. 

•• Real Talent: Unlike other vapid Toreador relying on their faces and bodies alone, you were Embraced for your talent. Choose one Skill from Craft, Etiquette, or Performance. Increasing this Skill costs half the experience points (rounded down) that such an increase would typically cost. 

••• Embrace the Stereotype: When the time comes, you can play the role of shallow Toreador, surround yourself with an entourage of sycophants, and throw a party that becomes legend. Once per story, you may host a party to increase your Status and/or Influence by two dots with an invited group; the increase lasts as long as the party does. 

•••• Divine Purity: Unlike most within Helena’s extended family, your perfection is more angelic than devilish. You can commit any sin, but you will always look innocent. Add two dice to your dice pools when making tests to avoid blame for your actions. 

••••• Succubus Club Franchise: Helena succumbed to the Beckoning in recent years, leaving the Succubus Club in Chicago to a manager once again. She bestowed a license upon you to establish a franchised Succubus Club in your domain. This rare honor guarantees the city’s Kindred respond to your call, as every vampire Embraced in the last 200 years has heard of the Succubus Club. As long as the club remains open, the Chasse rating of your coterie’s Domain increases by two dots. You also have four dots to select among Resources, Fame, and Status among all Kindred.
