Vasantasena and her Malkavian sire Unmada traveled the world throughout the Middle Ages, preaching against the Blood Bond. They rejected the vinculum, traditional Kindred hierarchy, and all loss of free will. Ultimately, they condemned the Antediluvians for their cruel tyranny through Jyhad, joining the Sabbat during its formation. As the Camarilla had, the Sabbat rejected her cause, instituting both hierarchy and ritual enslavement through vitae. She eventually rejected them in turn, assembling a faction of Malkavians to embrace freedom from the Sabbat. Vasantasena’s descendants are many and varied, and all of them followed her from the Sabbat before the sect’s recent, bestial devolution. Some joined the Camarilla, others the Anarchs. All possess the zeal and charm she wields like a knife. All fight for something. 

• Agent of Chaos: You thrive while everything around you burns or spins into catastrophe. In turbulent situations, such as an unusually chaotic and unpredictable combat, a car chase through a crowded city, or when fleeing an exploding building, once per session, you may re-roll a single die without spending Willpower. 

•• Hear My Words: You carry your ancestor’s skills of persuasion, finding your voice speaks to the Blood of others before it reaches their minds. Once per story, if you attempt to counsel others in a chaotic environment and they actually stop to listen, they may re-roll one dice pool in one future test during the same situation.

••• Scent the Bond: Vasantasena’s loathing of Blood Bonds was part of the reason she targeted the Antediluvians and the ties they maintained with their offspring. Such was her power that she could smell the Bond on individual vampires and recognize the same odor on the vampire Bonded to, or Bonding, them. Once per story, on a successful Resolve + Awareness test (Difficulty 4), you can do the same. 

•••• Destroy the Bond: Vasantasena’s greatest act is the destruction of the Blood Bond. Some say she performed this act many times in recent years among the Sabbat, in part leading to their rapid degeneration. Once per story, you too can remove the Blood Bond imposed on a victim, if you drink a mouthful of the thrall’s vitae and then ride out a frenzy. 

••••• Sabbat Becomes Camarilla: Vasantasena achieved the impossible and showed her descendants how it was done. Alien, inhuman philosophies locked most vampires into the Sabbat. Once per story, you can deprogram a vampire from their sect beliefs. To do so, you must completely isolate the subject and make an extended test (p. 293) of either Intelligence or Charisma + Insight in an atmosphere of specialized perfumes. Roll once per three nights of disputation; you win after achieving a number of successes equal to twice the subject’s Willpower.
