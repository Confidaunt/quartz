Few figures among the foundations of the Clan of Death are as ancient and enigmatic as Roger de Camden. Known by many names throughout history, the shadowy Kindred who now rules as Prince of Edinburgh has spent lifetimes studying and honing an intimate understanding of the boundaries between life and death. A scholar, martyr, and a survivor, de Camden walked among the eldest Cappadocians, his powerful vitae resonating down through the centuries all the way to tonight’s Hecata. To you. Whether through the boasts of your sire, or poring over a dusty book of names delivered to your haven, you have discovered that you are a descendant of Roger De Camden himself. LORE

• Proud Childe: Your grandsire is among the most storied and respected of any to walk among the Clan of Death. While within any Hecata controlled domain, haven, or social gathering, you have two dots of Status (••).

•• Corpsense: You follow in your ancestor’s footsteps with a fascination and understanding of the deceased. You gain two dice to any pool for investigating the cause of injury or death of a body. At any time, if a nearby wraith chooses to, they can always communicate to you with ease.

••• Eye to Eye: Roger de Camden’s relationship with the godlike Ventrue Mithras was deep, complex, and the gossip of generations. While the Blue Bloods respect little outside their own clan, they recognize how significant de Camden was to the lonely unlife of one of their greatest. You receive a benefit of two dice to all pools for Persuasion or Intimidation actions when dealing with Kindred of Clan Ventrue, and careful mentions of your lineage could get you through doors non-Ventrue might normally never pass.

•••• The Way of all Flesh: The bloodline of de Camden screams out to the spirits of the recently deceased, dragging them back to the physical realm long after they should have departed forever. You can perform the Embrace as normal on an old corpse so long as it has not rotted beyond recognition. This rebirth is far more traumatic than usual, and the fledgling is deeply affected by whatever they experienced in their brief time between lives.

••••• Perchance to Dream: Like your forefather before you, you are forever preoccupied with the world of the dead, their souls so close you can almost reach out to touch them. Occasionally during your daily rest, or indeed when lying in torpor, your spirit wanders into the Shadowlands (see Cults of the Blood Gods). What you may see there, or what wraiths may be drawn to your presence, is anyone’s guess. If you are attacked while in the Shadowlands, you are immediately returned to your physical form, suffering one level of Superficial Willpower damage.
