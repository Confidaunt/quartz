Long-seen as the Camarilla’s loyal lapdog, Theo’s recent defection to the Anarch Movement triggered shockwaves still felt throughout Camarilla domains. It was Theo Bell who served at the whims of the Ventrue Hardestadt and Jan Pieterzoon for years, even begrudgingly taking up arms for the Lasombra Marcus Vitel in recent years. It was also Theo Bell who fired the first shot at the Convention of Prague, ultimately causing Hardestadt’s and Pieterzoon’s deaths. Kindred gossip these nights positions Theo Bell as an unwilling messiah among the Anarchs. He desires no position of leadership; he just got sick of bending over for blue bloods and snapped. His actions compelled hundreds of Brujah to follow suit, taking out the Princes who long lorded over them and forming Anarch bastions alongside the Gangrel. Despite his notoriety, Theo still acts as liaison between high-status Camarilla and Anarchs, for the sole reason that he brooks no shit at meetings. He short-circuits Sabbat ambushes, quells any Anarch riots, and shuts down Camarilla extortion and coercion. As a mediator, Theo’s judgement cannot be faulted. 

Rebel Cell: You command a pack of rebellious mortals and fuel their fire with something that keeps them fighting. Perhaps you feed them vitae or maybe you embody their ideals. Either way, these rebels (a three-dot Ally group equivalent) perform a single dangerous task for you without your presence, before disbanding until the next story. 

True Anarch: You were an Anarch before Bell led an army of Camarilla Brujah into the Anarch Movement, and you resent these tagalongs joining the Anarchs just as they grow popular. You have records, names, places, and dates about who the rebels were and are, fed to you by the Man or gathered personally. Either way, you get two automatic successes on any Investigation test concerning vampires who defected to the Anarch Movement. 

Contact Information: Whether by dead drop, messenger, or arcane means, you can get word to Theo. Whether he responds, or even listens, depends on the message and your earlier interactions, but if he likes what you have to say, he might be able to move mountains. The precise game effects of a message to Theo are up to the Storyteller. 

Bell’s Circle: Theo trusts you, perhaps because of your earlier revolutionary actions or because you manipulated your way into his good graces. Bell is equivalent to a five-dot Mawla, but your association with him also has many drawbacks. 

Sect Neutrality: Following Theo Bell’s lead, you have a small contingent of a few Brujah loyal to your vision, and you can influence them in any direction: the Camarilla, the Anarchs, or even to form a smaller subsect neutral amidst the Jyhad. You may resent their existence or take pride in your following. Not mindless disciples, these Kindred keep track of favors granted. But until they rebel against you, you have five dots to spend among Contacts, Haven (safe houses), Mawla, and Retainers.
