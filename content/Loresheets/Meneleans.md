The Meneleans once sought to rebuild Carthage. Under the guidance and vitae of Menele, their patron Methuselah, they learned the lost city’s secrets. They believed vampires had a higher purpose and enlightenment could be found through assimilation with humanity. They struggled for a fairer society for the Kindred. To the Meneleans, once of the greatest forms of tyranny was one that elders held over younger generations. When Menele vanished and the cult’s blood bonds shattered, his cultists were fully aware of the irony. Abandoned by their Methuselah, the Meneleans search for meaning. How much of their faith came from their own morals, and how much came from Menele’s direct influence? Though they may never know for sure, some press on. You are one of those adherents. You’ve set aside any questions of whether or not you’ve been manipulated, because you still feel that Menele had ideas worth spreading. You’ve come away from the experience with insights into the blood bond that the rest of the domain is keen to hear. LORE

• Mortal Empathy: You believe in the importance of cleaving to humanity and ensure you see them as people, not just as food. Once per chapter, you may reroll any failure on a Social roll involving mortals.

•• Peacemaker: Menele’s school taught you the importance of conflict resolution. Those around you tend to see you as a voice of reason. Once per chapter, when you are involved in a social or physical conflict, you gain two bonus dice in an attempt to resolve things through diplomacy. If one of your allies (such as a retainer or member of your coterie) then breaks the terms of your negotiation, you must roll to resist fury frenzy.

••• Show of Defiance: Tyranny is the enemy of peace. One of the best ways to prevent it is to humble the powerful. Once per story, when you chastise or humiliate someone in a higher position of authority than you, you may add the number of dots you possess in Status as bonus dice to your roll to cajole the individual or persuade the crowd to turn against them. The outcome of using this Loresheet is a likely Adversary possessing dots equivalent to your target’s power level.

•••• Becoming the Mask: You’ve assimilated into humanity so well you have a separate, almost mortal life. You receive an identity represented by Mask 2 and may split two dots between Contacts, Resources, and Influence. When you take on this Mask, you take on mortal connections, including family and friends (assumed to have been cultivated in the build-up to this Loresheet), though they pose risks to your security and privacy as they’ll ask the usual questions of “where are you going to work these days?”, “why are you out all night?”, and “why did someone come to my door saying you’re a vampire and part of something called a charcuterie?”.

••••• Bond Breaker: The dissipation of Menele’s blood bond permanently changed you. You’ve become Unbondable (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 181), and feeding a Rouse Check’s worth of vitae to a thrall immediately breaks the regent’s hold. However, you are incapable of creating your own blood bonds.
