Starfall Ranch is well-known as one of the top ranches in the Northeastern United States. Its cattle are consistent state fair winners. Its horses have been seen at dressages and other equestrian sports events around the world. Owning these animals come at a high price, and part of that premium involves the quality service of Alberta Pennilee and the expert training of a man only known as “Dr. Starr.” Starr is Kindred. He serves the One Moon, a faith that believes that Clan Malkavian is actually one single person, experiencing themselves and the world around them through the lives and perspectives of those they Embrace. Aside from being a popular grange, Starfall Ranch serves as a halfway house for dispossessed Malkavians. There, they can work, feed, and learn their place as part of the One Moon. Starfall Ranch plays a major part in your life, whether you once worked there after your Embrace, or you still call it home. You might know the secrets of Starr’s ranch hands, or the basic philosophies of the One Moon. Perhaps you had the privilege of meeting the Methuselah that sleeps beneath the farmland. LORE

• Herd Mindset: Your time on the ranch brought you closer to your fellow wayward Malkavians. Sometimes this was a bit too close, and parts of their identities still linger within you. Once per chapter, you may either take two dots in a Skill you do not know for a single roll, or as the Storyteller for one fact about an SPC that you do not know. The Storyteller decides on which fact is received.

•• Clarity of Mind: Starfall Ranch is a peaceful place. Here, Malkavian from all levels of society can rest and reflect upon their future. Those that do find that they have a better chance of achieving their greater ambitions. When you start a Project at Starfall Ranch, you receive three bonus dice to the Launch roll.

••• New Perspectives: You understand some basics of the One Moon, and you’re starting to discover how you are only a single aspect of a greater person. You can even borrow the talents and abilities of your faith’s other followers. Once per story, you may take one Skill rating and replace it with that of another One Moon cultist. This may either be another player’s character or an SPC.

•••• Starr and Marta: You’ve had the chance to see Marta with your own eyes, and it changed you forever. You may take Dr. Starr as a four dot Mawla. Once per story, Marta will speak through him. You may ask her any relevant question to the story, and she answers truthfully, to the best of her knowledge.

••••• But I Saw You Die: Starr is infamous for cheating death. He’s shared his secret with you. Once, when you undergo final death, you may select another One Moon cultist SPC. This SPC is now you, even taking on your physical likeness if possible. Your Skills, Advantages, Flaws, and any out-of-clan Discipline dots remain, but you must redistribute your Attributes and your in-clan Discipline dots.
