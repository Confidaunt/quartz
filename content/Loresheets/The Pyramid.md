It was not so long ago the Tremere were the strongest clan, or at least, one of the most organized. You know the Pyramid was a perfect structure for Kindred hierarchy, enforcing loyalty through bonds of Blood and oaths of loyalty to house and family, ensuring power rose to the top, with the rewards trickling down. Or perhaps you studied the Pyramid for the corrupt bastion it was, and celebrated its collapse. You know the inner workings of the Tremere Pyramid. You could construct such an hierarchy again, or help to erode it.  

• Apprentice: Despite their recent destabilization, most sires of Clan Tremere still readily awards their fledglings the rank of apprentice. You are one such apprentice, or the master of one, awarding you with the equivalent of a one-dot Mawla. 

•• Savant: Despite your new entry into the Pyramid, you have already drawn the attention of members greater than yourself for a successful experiment in which you courted danger, the creation of a new minor ritual, or the discovery of lore once lost to the clan. Once per chronicle, this lore enables you to ask a major boon of a Regent, and providing the boon is not insulting, remain on good terms with that Tremere thereafter. 

••• Regent: Every chantry has a Regent. The Regent is responsible for the tutelage of all other Tremere in the domain. While the Regent may not teach them personally, she must ensure all Tremere are being educated. The Regent’s other duties extend to the clan’s protection in the domain, and sometimes its representation on the Primogen Council. You are the Regent of a chantry. This gives you a dot in Tremere Status, as well as three dots in Haven, representing the chantry. Be aware that you are expected to oversee the safety of the chantry, as well as provide lodging and resources to other members of the clan. 

•••• Pontifex: Each Warlock on the Council of Seven has seven Pontifices reporting to him. These Pontifices will oversee a vast domain, though it is rarely geographically defined. Different Pontifices are appointed as clan representatives in the fields of art, economics, werewolf studies, and other such fields. You are seen as the clan’s foremost expert in whichever domain you’re made Pontifex, and your resources regarding that field are extensive. You gain a three dice bonus to any information-gathering test relating to your particular field, provided you have access to your library, as well as three dots in Tremere Status. 

••••• The New Council: The new Tremere Council of Seven was assembled as an emergency measure following the Second Inquisition’s successful attack in Vienna. The explosion was timed to coincide with a meeting between the Council’s members, rendering all but a couple into ash, while the remainder entered torpor. You are considered one of the new potential members of the Council of Seven because you have something unique to offer the Tremere clan. What that is and how you wield your power is up to you and the Storyteller. You also have four dots in Tremere Status.
