Prince Peisistratos of Athens has long nurtured an appreciation for the dramatic arts, especially when used to commemorate the illustrious past of the Hellenes. His troupe of ghouls, kept in relative luxury in his palace nestled under the Acropolis, enjoy an envied but precarious position in the Prince’s court. Although prized for their acting talent and extensive knowledge of classical Greece, they exist in a state of perpetual threat, should their performance fall short of the Prince’s exacting taste. Still, for those given a choice, it’s a risk worth taking—because the one who earns the Prince’s favor can also hope to taste the gift of his Embrace. 

• Silent Actor: Your life as a ghoul is over, but you are still not given speaking parts in the Prince’s tragedies. However, you've found that people tend to underestimate the power of silence, and you can use that to your advantage. Your silent years have allowed you to cultivate your powers of observation. It’s amazing what one can discover if they can just keep their mouth shut. Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller for a piece of information that is hidden from everyone else, but is obvious to you. 

•• It Speaks: You proved yourself to the Prince and you were finally given speaking parts in his troupe, performing in front of Kindred and mortals. Gain Fame ( ) and two extra dice whenever performing plays you learnt with the troupe. One of the troupe ghouls is jealous of you, earning you Enemy ( ) Flaw. 

••• No Longer In The Shadows: Years spent on stage made you crave attention, and you know you shine best when all the lights are on you. Whenever members of your coterie make a significant attempt to stay low (using Stealth or Composure rolls) with you present, you can automatically cause them to fail in exchange for 3 additional dice to your next Charisma roll. 

•••• Diva: You have been part of the Prince’s troupe for as long as you can remember. You’ve persevered through long years of hard work and abusive impresarios, and survived the jealousy and sabotage of your fellow players. Now is your time to shine. Kindred are a tough crowd, but these nights you lack neither the talent nor the experience to be truly irresistible. Distribute three dots among Fame and Herd, and two additional dice to your performances while on stage. Gain Enemy ( ) Stalker. 

••••• Impresario: Long gone are the days when you were afflicted by stage fright before the cold gaze of a dead-hearted audience. Now you know the ins and outs of the Prince’s court, and exactly how to put together a show that will bring you the results you want. Gain three dots to distribute among Influence and Status. Once per story, gain three dice to a Performance roll of your choice, meant to sway the minds of others to your gain, sending a clear message to your audience (like “we need to unite against the common enemy”, “do not trust the Prince”, “Anarchs are the only future for this domain”). Messy Critical or Bestial Failure on this roll may end up in disastrous consequences to your cause.
