Though formally abandoned with the rise of the Camarilla, some clans still consider themselves “High,” compared to their peers among “Low Clans.” You are a vampire from a High Clan, convincing you that you have certain rights to bully and order those of Low Clans. These rights can only be pushed so far, of course. Historically, the High Clans were Lasombra, Toreador, Tzimisce, and Ventrue, though Brujah and some of the Clan of Death clung to the epithet. In various parts of the world, the members of the High Clans change to include the Banu Haqim and Ministry, and rarely, the Tremere. As a High Clan vampire, your clan bane is, to your mind, less a curse than a blessing. 

• Peacock: You are proud of your clan’s status as High, and you carry yourself with all the pomp and circumstance befitting a vampire of noble station. Once per session, you may re-roll a single die when attempting to command deference from one non-titled vampire in your domain. 

•• Sway the Low: The High Clans once sat upon thrones, ordering Low Clan vampires to die for them on battlefields and to subjugate themselves in court. You still possess the ability to persuade vampires of Low Clans more easily than you do the vampires of High Clans. You have bullied the equivalent of three dots of Mawla into a loyal, abused retinue of Low Clan vampires. You gain three extra dice to pools using Intimidation or Leadership against those Kindred; if you ever roll a total failure on such a test or contest, you need to compensate them, or they turn on you. 

••• Elevate the Low: Some quirk of your bloodline or an ancient Princely decree allows you to proclaim the ascendancy of one Low Clan in your city to High Clan status. You can do this once per chronicle, but of course, you can promise to do it “eventually” for quite a while fir st. Until then, add one die to Social tests against Low Clan Kindred when you allude to this possibility. 

•••• Embraced to Rule: Vampires of the High Clans often opted to Embrace mortals of noble birth or powerful ancestry. Your ancestors may not be kings and queens, but you were Embraced to rule. Add one die to pools for Leadership tests involving High Clan vampires who know your lineage. Once per story, other vampires of the High Clans defer to voting for you, or they allow you to take high responsibility (and power), unless you have created a personal grievance between you. 

••••• Blessed, not Cursed: Like many vampires of the High Clans, you have convinced yourself that you bear no Curse of Caine. Rather, your clan weakness is a blessing that reveals more to you about your nature, your position on God’s Earth, and the areas in life you must strengthen. Once per session, you may spend one Willpower to ignore the burdens of your clan bane.
