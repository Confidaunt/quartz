Most Ministers have rediscovered their cosmopolitan, multi-faith routes. While they still revere Set as their founder and the first vampire, it is less common for a Setite of the Ministry to cling only to the worship of Sutekh. This is not the case among those Setites who claim membership in the very Church of Set. Dedicated to the rites of Setite Orthodoxy, the Church of Set’s members believe they must conspire to weaken all other clans and their founders in order to pave the way for the resurrection of their founder. Your membership in the Church of Set may be as a new adherent, desperate to find meaning and mentorship in a hostile world, or you may be one of the dedicated faithful, rejecting the idea of enslavement to other Antediluvians and seeking freedom from all chains by following Set’s holy guidance. 

• Congregation: You have access to a herd of kine, but these mortals are a unified religious flock you can manipulate. This congregation can belong to any mainstream of fringe religion, and whether they see you as their leader, or just another parishioner, you can feed from them easily. This lore is equivalent to a two-dot Herd, though it requires you to show up and uphold the faith regularly. 

•• Tap the Secret Vein: Through the method of a simple interview, you can analyze whether a mortal or Kindred has a secret they’re trying to hide. You gain a two-dice bonus to Insight-based tests to find whether someone is keeping a secret. 

••• Freedom from the Aeons: Set despises his fellow clan founders, or so the legend says. The Setites consider the other founders Aeons, and demonstrate a resistance to their power. You gain two additional dice on rolls resisting Dominate and Presence attempts from vampires of other clans. 

•••• Degenerative Process: The Church of Set teaches its adherents that a man must be brought to his lowest before he can rise to meet glorious Sutekh. You can push any being, mortal or immortal, to indulge in degenerative corruption only to come out clean on the other side. With a successful Manipulation + Persuasion roll, you can persuade any individual to break a Tenet or Conviction, gaining at least one Stain. When it is done, they feel purified. The targeted character restores up to three Superficial or one Aggravated Willpower damage. 

••••• Body of Set: You possess a fragment of Set’s skeleton, sarcophagus, or burial robes. Though the implication of Set’s Final Death is debatable, the holy (or unholy, depending on your perspective) artifact gives you drive to succeed and impressive influence over other Followers of Set, conveying a four-dot Status among other Ministers. The relic also helps you to touch the mind of Set through meditation, and once per story you are able to reduce Stains gained from breaking a Tenet by one, if following what you and the Storyteller perceive as the will of your god.
