The Rossellini and the Giovanni were once rivals in necromancy. The Rossellini had more talent, but the Giovanni had more ambition. That led to the latter becoming the Clan of Death for 500 years, and the other becoming a minor bloodline. The two families share many traits, save for one: ghost manipulation. The Giovanni prefer to coax and cajole, with an occasional threat. The Rossellini begin with threats, browbeating, and dominating wraiths into doing their bidding. The Family takes a sadistic glee using Oblivion. As a Rossellini, the Shadowlands are your playground. Sure, your enslaved wraiths were human, just like you were, but you conquered death. They are the pitiful remains, doomed to lament about what they once had. The least you can do is give purpose to their miserable unlives. One day you’ll die and join their sorrowful ranks, but for now, you will show your cousins the true depths of Oblivion. LORE

• Grave Attitude: Your experience commanding wraiths taught you that even the Kindred will eventually cross the Shroud. This certainty gives you peace. In any attempt to intimidate or manipulate you, your aggressors always suffer a one die penalty, which stacks with other penalties.

•• Ghostly Dominance: You brook no tolerance for the pleas and threats of the intangible dead. They are your tools. If they don’t see it that way, you will remind them. When you damage a wraith’s fetter, loved ones, or ectoplasmic form, you receive three bonus dice to any rolls to command them.

••• Necromantic Expertise: Your siblings in the Giovanni see Oblivion as a means to an end. You know Oblivion is more than that. It’s a wonderous art, one that rewards those with the patience and ruthlessness to examine its depths. When you perform an Oblivion Ceremony, decrease the Difficulty level by one.

•••• Stolen Will: Ghosts are bundles of emotion cased in an ectoplasmic shell. While some Hecata slake their hunger from ghosts, you know a more sustainable use. When you bite into the fetter of a ghost under your command hard enough to damage it or cause it injury, the fetter bleeds ectoplasm drawn from the ghost’s corpus. Consuming this bitter, stringy substance mends an amount of Aggravated or Superficial Willpower damage equivalent to the ghost’s Willpower rating.

••••• Purge: You shred corpuses with ease. Any attack made on a ghost always causes Aggravated Health damage, even outside of the Shadowlands. You are also capable of striking them when they are intangible.
