Few Kindred in Canadian domains fuel the ever-churning rumor mill quite like the enigmatic Nosferatu, Sheriff Qui. Even the dullest of fledglings recognize that his given name is a monik er, but only those close to him know his true identity as J ames Coyle, a name he left behind in the U nited States decades ago. Qui’s most distinguishing feature, or lack thereof, is the absence of his clan’s monstrous disfigurements with the notable exception of a sinuous, pulsating sc ar that snakes down the back of his ne ck. How was the curse altered? Neither bribery nor threat have been successful in wresting the secret from him. 

Qui’s time in Canada has be en punctuated by cycles of extreme violence: He arrived as a recruit in a successful coup, only to see his ally, the newlyminted Prince Cranston, slaughtered by Montreal’s Sabbat hordes. He was able to save one vampire from the flames—Cranston’s Seneschal, Arundel— who then raised him to the office of Sheriff soon after he took pr axis. Qui has remained fiercely loyal to his Prince ever since, acting as both investigator and executioner. 

• Ally of an Ally: You've worked for Qui in the past—but not directly. You've never actually met the Sheriff, but that doesn't necessarily stop you from using the association to your advantage. Once per story you may successfully talk your way out of (or into) trouble by invoking Qui's name at the Storyteller’s discretion. 

•• He calls his Car "She": Before his appointment as Sheriff, Qui was known as a discreet and reliable fixer. Adept as he is at detective work and assassination, he still needed a source for inconspicuous vehicles and other tools of the trade. You were one of his favored suppliers, gaining his gratitude for procuring a particular silver sedan that he still favors for stakeouts. Gain a two dice bonus on Finance, Streetwise, or Persuasion tests involving selling or obtaining vehicles and vehicle parts. 

••• Private Eye: You were tutored by Qui in the subtle art of sleuthing and you’ve spent years honing your skills. In a rare moment of candor, the Sheriff professed that you were one of the most capable students he’d ever trained. Gain Specialty (Sleuthing) to either Investigation or Streetwise, and once per story, add four dice to a roll using this specialty. 

•••• Comrades in Arms: Many years ago, you assisted Qui in the successful defense of Ottawa against Montreal's Sabbat raiders. Those few who survived the destruction of Prince Cranston in the subsequent ill-fated counter-attack regard you as an ally. They've scattered to other domains since, but some may be called upon in times of need. These comrades count as a three-dot Mawla and will fight on your behalf once per story. They must be given 24 hours’ notice to arrive and get ready for action. In addition to standard battle prowess, they will also give one automatic success in any conflict involving the Sabbat. 

••••• Dangerous Secrets: You've worked closely with Qui in the past and learned a key piece of the secret to his subversion of the Nosferatu curse. Whether this information is entirely accurate or not is immaterial: powerful Kindred believe that it's true and will offer you a major boon in exchange for everything you know. If you choose to sell, you gain six dots to spend on any combination of Contacts, Influence, Haven, and Resources. Divulging this information will make an enemy of Qui, who counts as a four-dot Adversary. Keeping the secret earns Qui’s respect and you may call on him once per chronicle as a four-dot Mawla.
