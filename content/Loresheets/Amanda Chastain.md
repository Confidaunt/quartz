Once a lowly neonate among the Toreador of Chicago, Amanda Chastain ventured out to the small town of Jericho Heights to set up her own domain where her influence now reaches every part of the town. Having made most of her money in sales of cryptocurrencies and stock futures, she started her new domain with considerable resources. It took little time for her to establish herself in the small town. She propped up a puppet mayor, Bonded him along with the sheriff, and set up a node for the Circulatory System.

Still drawn to fame, a vestige from her early days in vaudeville in the 1920s, she now hosts a popular podcast that reaches tens of thousands of loyal fans each day. Her influence over the people of Jericho Heights knows no limits, and her sphere of influence continues to widen, stretching across the county, and even into Chicago.
