Toreador Primogen Annabelle has been involved in Kindred politics for nearly two centuries. She’s served on the council throughout the reigns of four Princes and survived fires, purges, and Lupine attacks. So far, she seems unaffected by the Beckoning. Some of her enemies (and a non-zero number of her allies) whisper about what it is that lets her come through so many calamities unscathed. Is she that politically savvy, and has simply made smart bargains and surrounded herself with strong protectors? Or does some mysterious benefactor watch her from the shadows, stepping in to keep her out of harm’s way? Annabelle throws frequent parties — one or more a week — where invitees can rub elbows with the powerful, admire art both new and old, and set any number of political plates spinning. Though other Cainites find it amusing to scoff at her taste in art, only a rare few do so to her face. While she might not have an eye for masterpieces, it’s foolish to assume she therefore has no head for politics. Annabelle’s connections span not only Kindred society but run deep into mortal affairs as well. Her money and influence are extremely welcome in the art world. She still maintains contacts within the media under her human guise, Elaine Stanley-Greer. Although her husband’s newspaper empire shut down 20 years ago, she knows who to call to get a story pulled or a headline bumped to the front page.

• Intern: Fledgling vampires who want to learn the ins and outs of Kindred politics often spend time working for Annabelle.

•• Glitterati: Whether you’re this week’s one-hit wonder or are famous by virtue of your last name, your presence makes Annabelle’s parties more interesting. Once per story, you can get on the guest list for an event to which you weren’t previously invited by simply asking “Do you know who I am?”

••• With Thanks to Our Donors: Annabelle knows someone at every museum and recording studio in town. Once per story, she will pull strings to get you a meeting with someone in charge, but the rest is up to you.

•••• Patronage: Your exceptional talents have drawn Annabelle’s eye. She invites you to sing at an exclusive gathering, or finds a buyer for your latest painting.

••••• Inner Circle: You’ve proven indispensable to Annabelle. She heeds your judgment and entrusts you with sensitive information. Once per story, she will present an issue of your choice (at the Storyteller’s discretion) before the Primogen council.
