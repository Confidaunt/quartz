Ambrus Maropis rarely leaves his opulent apartment in Cyprus to meet the public, yet his reputation as a trend-setter and Masquerade protector spreads widely throughout Kindred society. The Toreador who know that Ambrus is a Nosferatu loathe the vampire’s popularity. His disciples, akin to superfans, act as gobetweens to Princes and Barons while he remains forever hidden. Ambrus has a reputation as a vampire on the cutting edge of technology and culture. Embraced in his late teens, Ambrus is, at heart, an introverted fan of anime, gaming, and online roleplaying, with an elaborate online persona. Ambrus uses this persona to sell soft - ware and information he hacks; advise on the best security methods stolen from governments and corporations for Kindred to utilize; inform Elysia about emerging musicians, entertainers, and trends; and make himself an invaluable resource to Camarilla and Anarchs who want to appear more human than human. 

• True Believer: If Ambrus has taught you anything, it’s that the Camarilla is right and the Masquerade is essential. You follow his edicts on security and subterfuge religiously, granting you knowledge of the best shared Kindred hiding places in a city, providing a one-die bonus to tests to find such a place. You may not have access to this bonus if the domain is typically opposed to your political or philosophical view. 

•• Clandestine Information: You can use a digital dead drop to request a hack from Ambrus’ fan community. Once per story, you can get one piece of information stored online about most mortals within two to 20 hours. 

••• Taught by the Best: As one of Ambrus’ disciples, you are provided with a ready supply of intel on topics from Second Inquisition operations to the fashion in Harajuku tomorrow night. Ambrus can also time-lock information in the Dark Web or set you up with your own Ukrainian hacker at “friend prices.” Consider Ambrus a three-dot Mawla ( ). 

•••• Back Door Panopticon: Ambrus hooked you up with a back door into PRISM/NUCLEON surveillance software, tracking and sorting online communications (including cell phone calls) for keywords and names. Or perhaps you stole it from him or found it on a machine in a safe house an Ambrusite abandoned in a hurry. Either way, you can only log in once per story for security’s sake, but it gets you two automatic successes on any Investigation test involving anyone’s cell activity or online presence. 

••••• On Another Grid Entirely: Ambrus went all out with your false identity. You have two two-dot Mask ( ) cover identities and have been Zeroed (p. 192). You get three extra dice to resist attempts to research you online or uncover your activities in the mortal world.
