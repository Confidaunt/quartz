Victor Temple is, in his own words, the “Undis- puted Baron of the Valley.” This Ventrue controls the largest Anarch territories in Los Angeles, and perhaps in North America. Victor's enterprises include several popular nightclubs and an expanding music label business that he promotes under the name Temple of Boom.  

He also uses this entertainment empire to conceal his unlife — hiding in plain sight, as he likes to say. Victor may be based in L.A., but his influence is beginning to extend beyond his home domain: having a connection to the Baron can open up opportunities of wealth, power, and fame, as long as you maintain loyalty to Victor Temple himself, and don’t mistake his affability for complacency.  

• Chocolate Drop: You’re the new- est employee of Temple of Boom, either as a performer or promoter in your city. Gain a dot in Fame and a dot in Contacts. Your new found status has a downside: Gain the Stalker Flaw 

•• I Got Connections: The Temple of Boom is always looking for new talent, and they are not above poaching from competitors. At the Storyteller’s Discretion, you may request an advance on your salary, and add two dots of Re- sources or Contacts for the rest of the current Story, in exchange for procuring new talent for Temple of Boom 

••• This is Fine: Once per Story, you may name-drop Victor Temple and gain 3 extra dice to Social tests in a business/entertainment environment, such as gaining entrance to a nightclub, for the remainder of the scene. Should you do this, however, you will automatically become a person of interest to some- one who has beef with Victor Temple or the Temple of Boom in general. Gain the Enemy Flaw at one dot for the rest of the current Story. 

•••• Maharaja/Maharani: Temple of Boom isn’t just a recording label, but also a coveted name in the nightclub business. By demonstrating loyalty to the Temple of Boom business family, Victor Temple has granted you the right to open one of his clubs as a franchise in your city. Your Haven, Fame, Resources, and Herd all increase by one dot, and you receive a specialty in either Finance (accounting) or Performance (showmanship). Due to Victor Temple’s tactic of “hiding in plain sight”, your as- sociation with the club will gain you the Compromised Haven Flaw. 

••••• If Not Now, When?: Victor Temple owes you a Major Boon. Whether you obtained this from him personally, or got it through transfers, it is the most valuable currency you own. At Storyteller Discretion, you may personally request something significant from the wealthy, influential Ventrue, such as access to Hunter weapons or even the phone number of a local Werewolf. Should you do this, the Ivory Tower will not be able to ignore your connection to the Anarch Movement. Gain the Shunned (Camarilla) Flaw.
