Attend any Kindred gathering and you’ll see signs and sigils of clan affiliation everywhere: the Toreador with roses twining around her sleeves, the Ventrue with scepters embroidered on his lapels. Over the millennia, Cainites have raised their symbols not only to an art form, but to an entire language of its own. Out on the cities’ streets, Neonates and Anarchs have taken those icons and others and created images that offer information at a glance. They warn those savvy enough to interpret them that a particular rack has been claimed by a coterie, or that there’s a safe place to rest for the day just ahead. What looks like a wall covered in plain old graffiti to human eyes speaks volumes to vampires. LORE

• Iconographer: You’re versed in Kindred symbols, able to identify someone’s clan by the motifs in their clothing and could lecture neonates on how and why the imagery has changed over the centuries. Add two dice to relevant Academics rolls.

•• The Writing on the Wall: You’ve learned to look for marks other Kindred have left behind. Gain three dice on relevant Streetwise rolls when looking for information on local domains and vampires available in graffiti, posted flyers, or other artwork in the area.

••• Trendsetter: You make this look good. Your style catches eyes in Elysium, and other Kindred look to see what you’re wearing this week. Add two dice to Social rolls when you’re decked out in the imagery of your clan or chosen affiliation.

•••• Graffiti Artist: Those warnings on the wall? That’s your design. Your murals are works of art, and have drawn the eye not only of coteries heeding your warnings, but of Toreador who come to admire it. You may even have attracted the attention of Annabelle herself. Craft rolls regarding your art receive three extra dice when involving Kindred iconography.

••••• Giorgio Who? You’ve dressed Princes and Primogen, subtly weaving clan iconography into the lines of a suit or the cut of a dress. You don’t make statements with your work, you make dissertations. Once per story, an outfit of your design grants two dots of Status to a character of your choosing for the session. Alternately, your scathing critique of another Kindred’s poor sartorial choices removes one dot of Status for the same period of time.
