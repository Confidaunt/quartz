Formal duels between Kindred have taken many forms over the ages, halting only with the rise of the Camarilla and its formal proscriptions against them. Since that time, duels have gone underground were largely confined to the domains of Anarchs, the Sabbat, secretive dueling societies, and cities with permissive princes like Milwaukee. Ancient duels known as “Trials of Death” were fought with strength and fang, two Kindred draining one another until one succumbs to desiccation or destruction. Contemporary duels employ swords, guns, stakes, or even flaming brands. Whatever the form, these turbulent nights have seen a resurgence in Kindred dueling — one that is unlikely to abate anytime soon. LORE

• Honorable Combatant: You are familiar with the rules, strictures, and customs of Kindred Dueling. You gain +2 dice to all Etiquette tests related to Kindred Dueling.

•• Fight Club: You have established a flourishing Kindred dueling society in your domain. This society is a lucrative venture and excellent way for Kindred to settle their differences but is frowned upon by the Prince and/ or Primogen of your domain. Gain three dots to distribute between Resources, Allies, or Contacts reflecting the profits and connections made through your society.

••• Stake Fighter: You honed your stake fighting skills to a razor’s edge through years of Camarilla honor duels or Anarch street fights. You ignore the ‒2 penalty for called shots when attempting to stake another vampire.

•••• Fire Eater: Duels with torches and flaming brands are increasingly popular among young Kindred out to demonstrate their courage. They have even become a rite of passage for many Anarchs. These duels are fought with one or two torches around a blazing bonfire, each participant fighting until one succumbs to their wounds or the terrors of Rötschreck. Once per game, you can call upon your experience with fire duels, ignoring the regular provocation to terror frenzy provided by a bonfire. The difficulty to resist terror frenzy induced by being burned is also reduced by one for the scene.

••••• Trials of Death: You are a veteran of countless Trials of Death or learned at the feet of a true master. You only remove one die from your pool when making a bite attack. Opponents directing bite attacks against you remove three dice from their pools. The Beast is particularly strong in you during these trials and slakes its thirst with wild abandon. After a successful bite attack, your opponent increases their Hunger by two instead of one.
