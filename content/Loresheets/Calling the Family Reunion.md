The Clan of Death, in all its forms, has alw ays had a gift for understatement. The latest, the so-called “Family Reunion,” was a combination of the strategic removal of some high-profile elders, the burying of some ancient axes — sometimes in another vampire’s head — and the subse quent unleashing of millions of outraged and ungrateful ghosts taking out centuries of pent-up ire on any necromancer they could find. You are party to the hasty (by Kindr ed standards) discussion between ancient enemies of the ne - cessity and utility of working tog ether. You may have been involved in some of the acts that le d to it, or you were present at the Reunion itself. In your own way, you’ve contributed to this new step in the Clan of Death. And even though you’ve become one big happy clan again, that doesn’t mean you just forgive and forget.

• The Kids’ Table: You were present at the dinner where the final details of the Reunion were discussed. You didn’t have any significant impact in the discussion, but you know what was debated, so you’re familiar with all the old animosities and arguments. You get two dice on any Persuasion checks against another Hecata who tries to resurrect old disagreements.

•• Updating the Rolodex: Not everyone gets along in the new-and-improved Hecata, but since you were present during the initial dealmaking, you now have access to a lot of new contacts. When asking for information or small favors, you have the equivalent of three dots of Status within the Hecata clan.

••• Hiding the Bodies: Even the Clan of Death doesn’t have the luxury of flaunting all the corpses they’ve left along the way. You were involved in the cleanup of a key murder, and a Hecata elder is greatly in your debt as a result. Once per story, you may remind them of that debt to cash in the effects of a minor boon or less (see Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 315). Once per chronicle, you may clear the debt in return for the effects of a major boon. Call upon them more often, or for favors beyond their reach, and they will grudgingly comply… only to become a persistent Adversary once your business concludes.

•••• Dealmaker: For all the visible debates during the Family Reunion, there were just as many backroom deals made in order to make the reunification of the Hecata a success. You were a part of one of those deals, and an influential elder in the Hecata owes you as a result. That elder counts as a five-dot Mawla Background but will become a potent Adversary if the secrets are ever revealed.

••••• Spiritual Assault: You were involved in the murder of Augustus Giovanni, the methuselah responsible for the alleged destruction of the Cappadocians. As such, you know it was Augustus’ death that unleashed the maelstrom of wraiths coming after the Hecata. Anytime you or someone who consults you uses an Oblivion Ceremony to deal with a spectre or other antagonistic ghost, you gain two automatic successes.
