Most vampires claim it’s a mythical state of enlightenment, but some few claim to have reached the fabled state of Golconda or know of others who managed it. Supposedly discovered by an ancient vampire named Saulot, Golconda is a state of perfect equilibrium between Humanity and the Beast. A vampire walking Golconda’s path can temper their Beast’s outrage, subdue their Hunger, and even stand in the daylight, or so it is said. The gifts accompanying Golconda’s achievement are great, and so many vampires make the pilgrimage. Few succeed on the journey. The route to reaching the state of Golconda has never been accurately recorded. Indeed, Saulot’s followers claim the journey is different for every vampire, dependent on their sins. What Golconda does to a vampire when they reach it is also disputed. Some claim it leads to a state of perfect serenity, while others say it makes a vampire into a cold-blooded shark of a predator, no longer susceptible to mindless rage, but just as hungry for blood. You may be a disciple of Golconda, a follower of Saulot’s words, or a Kindred who wishes to remove the misleading veil of Golconda from other vampires’ eyes. An elusive vampire named the Master of Ravens seeks to quash the myth of Golconda once and for all, and you may serve him in this task.  

• Seeds of Golconda: You have heard of Golconda and can educate others on its nature without seeming like a total amateur. Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller for guidance before taking an action, and they will tell you if that action will jeopardize the chance of pursuing Golconda. 

•• The One True Way: You own a copy of the Master of Ravens-penned “One True Way:” a treatise on the supposed realities of Golconda. This piece of work tells you that Golconda is a method to become an apex predator, rather than a spiritually redeemed monster. Once per story, this pamphlet gives you three extra dice in any Social test involving the nature of Golconda. 

••• Saulot’s Disciple: You cling to the ideals of Saulot: the vampire who traveled to Asia and returned bearing a third eye and the enlightenment of Golconda. You believe in Saulot’s teachings that Golconda is the ultimate way in which a Kindred can overcome their curse. You practice a dual existence, allowing your Beast and Hunger off the reins occasionally, so you can achieve serenity at other times. Whenever you willingly succumb to frenzy, make a note; you can automatically succeed on your next frenzy test. 

•••• Satisfy the Hunger: You do not need to feed as often as other vampires. Your Golconda focus is to suppress your constant Hunger, potentially at the expense of other Traits. Your temperance acts as an inspiration to many other vampires. Once per session, you may lower your Hunger by one (but not below one) without feeding. 

••••• Greet the Sun: You know Golconda’s secrets. You may be incapable of walking the path forever, but for as long as you do, you can brave full daylight without suffering harm. However, the night after you walk in sunlight, you wake in a Hunger frenzy. You can do this once per story.
