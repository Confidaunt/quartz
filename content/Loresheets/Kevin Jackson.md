Kevin Jackson is one of Lodin’s younger childer, a lieutenant Embraced to reorient the then-Prince’s influence over Chicago’s criminal underground, expected to succeed where Capone’s grip was beginning to fail, to bring those operations into the future where they belonged. Recognizing opportunity when he saw it, Jackson played the long game: acting the deferential head-thug-in-charge to his frequently paranoid sire’s face while building a massive personal power base behind his back. Lodin’s fall and presumed destruction presented Jackson with an unprecedented opportunity to seize power for himself — one he took his time to capitalize on, securing for himself the throne, vast influence among the Kindred, and access to his unlamented sire’s financial resources. These nights, Jackson is principally focused on solidifying his own powerbase, building alliances, and establishing his personal diplomatic cred. He has forged and maintained a peace with the local Lupines and may be about to cut a deal with the Lasombra that, if it goes off, will establish him as a force to be reckoned with among the Camarilla as a whole. Getting in on the ground level with him could be just the sort of leg up an ambitious young lick needs to get ahead in the Second City. LORE
