Led by the “Master of Ravens,” the One True Way encourages vampires to seek Golconda by mastering the Beast and becoming the ultimate predator. Followers gather in meetings and encourage everyone, including curious newcomers, to openly discuss the lowest, darkest moments in their unlife. This is for two reasons: to advise the Kindred on how to overcome their inhuman natures, and to gather secrets the cult can use to gain followers and power. The One True Way is banned in many domains across the world, but this has only seemed to increase its popularity. As a traveler on the One True Way, you know that Golconda isn’t about redemption, but about progression and mastery. You’ve learned much about the darkness within yourself and others. Taming the Beast is agonizing, and it resists at every turn, but you work at it the best you can. You know there’s times when the Beast must run free, but you take heart in knowing even this is under your control. You know the benefits of confession, which sooths the spirit and gives you secrets to hold over your friends and enemies. You hope you can fully understand your place as a human predator, and that one night your higher instincts and your Hunger will work in tandem. LORE

• Trust Me: Showing vulnerability is dangerous among Kindred, but it’s necessary for the One True Way. You know how to sidestep a vampire’s hesitance and get them to say things they’d never tell their closest friends. When you speak to a vampire with genuine empathy, the Difficulty of any roll to get them to tell the truth lowered by one.

•• Secret Keeper: Attending or running meetings let you in on so many secrets the Nosferatu consider you a trusted source. Once per story, when you act on a secret, a single roll concerning that secret gains two extra dice.

••• Beast Communion: You see your Beast as a separate persona. When it comes to the surface, it finds details you’ve missed. Whenever you roll a Messy Critical or a Bestial Failure, you may ask one question about the situation to your character’s Beast. Your Storyteller gives you a truthful answer in the voice of the Beast.

•••• Calling the Wave: You see your Beast as a companion. It’d be wrong to keep a companion locked away forever, and so you release it on your own terms. Once per story, you spend a point of Willpower to immediately enter frenzy and Ride the Wave (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 219).

••••• The Road from Hunedoara: When the Master of Ravens himself invited you to journey to Hunedoara, Romania to meet him, you accepted. He taught you much, and you have returned a near apex predator. No matter what heinous acts you commit in frenzy, you never suffer more than 1 Stain. This can only be applied once per story, and Convictions cannot further reduce these Stains. THE ON E T RU E WAY 107
