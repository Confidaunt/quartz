Camarilla domains learned the hard way that online communication is a death trap for Kindred. To escape the fires of the Second Inquisition, vampires have turned to physical couriers. Europe can sometimes rely on rooftop runners and the discretion of sewer-dwelling Nosferatu, but the vast empty spaces of the continents, especially the New World, require messengers to brave the open road. While ghoul couriers have the advantage of operating during the day, they can be vulnerable whenever they stop, so P rinces and Barons are sometimes forced to employ discreet and loyal Kindred to transport vital documents and artifacts. 

Whether you travel alone on a Yamaha cruiser or with a whole cr ew in an armored van, you know how to survive the r oads, and how to get under cover with your precious cargo before the sun rises. 

• Bucket: As long as you’re in an urban area or along a major road, you rarely have problems finding a ride for the night. Add two extra dice to your Intelligence + Streetwise rolls while looking for a temporary vehicle. Every success above the margin of difficulty gives some extra comfort and ensures you won’t instantly alert the police. 

•• Six in the Morning: You know a hundred forgotten caves, empty garages, and abandoned warehouses. Once per story, receive a four-dice bonus to a Survival test to find shelter, as long as you’re on a road or street and have a vehicle. Your temporary haven is big enough for a large van. 

••• Ride or Die: Unlife is filled with uncertainties, but at least there’s one thing you know you can always count on. Select one vehicle that you’ve had for at least one entire story; the bonus for operating and working on this vehicle is three dice. 

•••• Highway Harbinger: You’ve been delivering bad news long enough that vampires know your arrival spells trouble. For the first three nights in a new city after you announce yourself, you gain a three-dice bonus to all Intimidation, Investigation, and Streetwise tests with vampires, as people make stupid mistakes and rumors spread like wildfire. However, your coming is now ominous enough that a paranoid Prince or other notable vampire makes it their business to end you or drive you out. Gain a twodot Adversary for as long as you stay in the city. 

••••• Midnight Express: You know spotters, scouts, and fellow couriers across the country. They function as two dots in Contacts. In addition, once per story, you can order them to watch and clear the roads ahead of you for a single night, letting you maintain a highway speed of 75 miles per hour in even the worst bucket and 150 miles per hour in a high-end cruising vehicle like a Mercedes or a sports car. You need to decide on a start and end point before you set out. Your spotters clear out any mundane problems, like speed traps. They can’t protect you from vampires, Lupines, or other supernatural threats, but they can usually warn you or provide you with alternate routes if you come under fire.
