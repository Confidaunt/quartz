In the 1950s, the Milliner family joined Clan Giovanni out of spite. They weren’t known for their prowess with Oblivion, but their connections helped the clan survive major shifts in organized crime, and the rise of the Second Inquisition. Their only reward was more work and tighter restrictions on feeding and the Embrace, something the Family Reunion did little to rectify. The Milliners have the most responsibilities and the least respect. As a Milliner, you’re not a household name like the Clintons or the Waltons, but the right people double- take when they hear it. You know that the Giovanni haven’t and won’t give you the credit you deserve, and it’s a deep and simmering grudge, one of the most important among the many you hold. Now everyone is one big happy family, it’s time to air all those grudges out. After all, you’ve got plenty of new cousins that’d just love payback. LORE

• You Know Who I Am: The Milliners are a true American dynasty, and the name carries a power even now and outside of the United States. Once per story, when you invoke the legacy of the Milliner line, you may add three dice to a Social roll.

•• Family Bank: The family has plenty of money, but anyone that calls upon that fortune needs to repay with cash, blood, or labor. Once per story, you may borrow money from a new or existing Milliner SPC. You have Resources 5 for the rest of the story but owe that SPC a favor that must be fulfilled before the end of the story. Your Storyteller will tell you the favor, and the consequences you face if that debt isn’t repaid when the story ends.

••• Perfect Grudges: The Milliners are known for their grudges, but you’re the true poster child. When you are slighted or beaten on a roll by a SPC, you may create a Project (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 415) dedicated to taking revenge. Its Launch Roll automatically succeeds, and you may add two dice to any Goal Rolls. The character can have as many grudge Projects as their dots in Composure. Any aspirations of revenge beyond that limit are regular Projects.

•••• You Owe Me: The Milliners always get their due, even at the worst possible times. Once per story, you may spend a Willpower and declare an SPC in the scene owes you a favor in secret, and it’s now due. The SPC must fulfill that favor to the best of their ability by the end of the story, as decided by the Storyteller.

••••• Friends in High Places: The Milliners’ connections in law enforcement turned them on would-be vampire hunters. This is more difficult these days, but you still have the little black books. Pick a faction within the Second Inquisition (FIRSTLIGHT, the Entity, a local intelligence agency, etc.). Once per story, when that faction acts against you, you may automatically redirect that action onto any enemy Kindred SPC. If they survive, that SPC will know you are to blame.
