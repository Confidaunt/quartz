At the beginnings of Christianity, Gnostic heretics and Kindred exchanged information and Blood, creating the Cainite Heresy: the belief that Caine was the true messiah, Christ was the Second Caine, and Cainites are His angels on Earth, opposing the wicked Demiurge: the “God” of the Old Testament. The Inquisition burned the Heresy to its roots in the 15th century – but roots can grow back, if watered. The antinomianism of the Anarch Revolt and the millenarianism of Gehenna’s rising fertilized the Heresy in the last century. Vampires who use the Heresy to subvert human faiths and Cainites who truly believe in their divine mission evangelize the Heresy throughout Anarch circles. 

• Let He Who Hath Understanding: The Storyteller will give you one clue freely to understand, investigate, or detect the Heresy’s actions or plans, now or in previous centuries. You can use this lore once per story. 

•• Hand of the Heresy: Take a total of three dots from among Allies, Herd, Mawla, or Retainers to represent your role in the city’s Heretical deaconate. For example, if you took Herd and Mawla , you might bless a small cult of human worshipers and have a renowned scholar of the Heresy as your teacher. You also have the Dark Secret Flaw (Heresy) in some domains. 

••• Counter-Inquisition: You can smell True Faith on a human; if you need to test to do so, your pool is Resolve + your highest rating in Cainite Heresy. You might also oppose the Heresy, and instead use this gift to know who to trust. 

•••• Red Celebrant: You know the rituals and the specific dosages to induce the Red Pentecost in a human congregation: a kind of ecstatic religious version of the frenzy. During the Red Pentecost, humans act according to their worst natures. You can procure enough herbs and fungi for one ceremony per story; the Red Ceremony requires a Hunger check and may trigger frenzy in Kindred participants. 

••••• The One Named in Prophecy: You are a linchpin of the Heresy’s plans: perhaps they consider you an avatar of Caine, you possess the only copy of the Testimony of St. Panteleimon, or your vitae is the only effective sacrifice to Ialdabaoth to propitiate or distract the Demiurge. Every informed member of the Heresy, and many who simply want to curry favor with the Anarchs, know your role. Once per story, you can use this fact to dictate the winner of a Social conflict if you can give a plausible reason for that outcome.
