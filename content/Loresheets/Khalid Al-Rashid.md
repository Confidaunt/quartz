Ancient and powerful, Khalid was a well-respected member of Chicago’s Primogen, and still is to those who believe Cedrick Calhoun’s subterfuge. Khalid walked the earth for nearly a thousand years in continual battle against his Beast, always seeking, yet never achieving, Golconda. Khalid’s quests led him to Chicago in search of a legendary Inconnu. What he found was a city firmly in the grip of an unending Jyhad between Helena and Menele. Taking to the shadows, Khalid managed to remain unbeholden to either Methuselah and managed to identify a circle of Kindred equally free from their influence. Digging deeper, he found something else entirely, and may well be in hiding, met the final death, or worse. Khalid is your Primogen, Mawla, or even sire. You pity his inability to attain Golconda, but admire the fact that Khalid never, ever, quits. LORE

• Safe Haven: Khalid’s tutelage provides two dots to divide between the Haven Merits of Postern and Security System.

•• Deadly Stroke: Khalid was a master swordsman in life, and more so in death. You may have fought beside him during the War of Chicago, or studied at his feet as your Mawla. Either way, you learned well. Once per chronicle, you gain three dice to a single Melee test while using a sword.

••• Khalid’s Notebook: Khalid recorded his suspicions about the eternal war between Helena and Menele in a notebook filled with coded pages. He tore out many pages of this notebook and secreted them about Chicago and beyond. You have acquired pages from this book and the secrets they contain. Once per story, you may ask the Storyteller for one secret Khalid would have access to about Helena, Menele, or the identity of one Kindred under (or formerly under, in the case of Menele) their control.

•••• Wicked Garden: You learned from Khalid or discover notes he left behind about strange entities living in Lake Michigan with oblique references to his sightings and suspicions about the creature known as Nerissa Blackwater. Once per story, this knowledge reduces the difficulty of all Investigation tests involving Nerissa Blackwater or the being she serves by four. Total Failure means Nerissa becomes aware of your inquiry.

••••• Unbeholden: Khalid knew about Helena and Menele and assembled a coterie of “wild card” Kindred free from their influence. You are not presently under the control or dominion of Helena, Menele, or a similarly ancient vampire. Once per chronicle, you automatically escape one attempt by an ancient to ensnare you in their Jyhad. Work with the Storyteller to determine exactly how this feat occurs, but you manage to retain your freedom, for now.
