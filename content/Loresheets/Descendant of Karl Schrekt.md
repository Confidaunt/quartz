Clan Tremere is a hollow reflection of its former glories. With the Pyramid decapitated and its leadership scattered, Tremere traditionalists look to one vampire for authority: former Justicar, Karl Schrekt. A legend within his own clan and the Camarilla, Schrekt hunted vampires before his Embrace in 1235. For centuries, he acted as the Camarilla’s weapon against the Sabbat, Anarchs, and occult menaces. He suppressed or destroyed lore regarding Antediluvians, eliminated countless threats to the Masquerade, and did it all without mercy. He earned his share of disciples, but few enemies. Those he got, he killed. Now he’s one of the eldest Tremere remaining. Schrekt’s descendants largely follow their ancestor’s hardline clan and sect views: enforce the Traditions, strengthen the clan, and hide the se crets of Blood magic from other vampires. 

• Remember the House: Once per story, you can ask the Storyteller for one piece of information regarding the activities of House Tremere or the clan before its grievous injury. 

•• Hardliner: Schrekt’s way is the only way forward for your clan. You follow Schrekt’s laws fanatically. With the Storyteller’s agreement, add two dice to any dice pool when testing to resist attempts to sway you from Schrekt’s goals. 

••• Ritual Preparedness: Allegedly, Karl Schreckt prepares all of his rituals in advance and keeps several such-pre prepared rituals about his person at all times. Once per story, you may perform one of your rituals in five minutes, without preparation, having done all the preparations beforehand. 

•••• Archon’s Bane: You find Schrekt’s targeting of supernatural entities deplorable, and you have formed a tight bond with a member of another supernatural background. You have a four-dot Ally: a mage, werewolf, wraith, changeling, or something even stranger. You must keep your friend safe, as they are being hunted. Once per story, they come to your aid within one to ten hours when called. 

••••• Know the World: Karl Schrekt believes knowledge is power and that vampires who limit their learning to the study of fellow Kindred are fools. Whether Schrekt’s puppet or nemesis, you agree with his assessment and keep archives on werewolves, magi, wraiths, fae, and other weird entities. This collection equates to a three-dot Haven Library (pick three suitable specialties of Occult), although you might not store your reference materials in your haven. Also once per story, you can ask the Storyteller to answer any simple question related to such creatures.
