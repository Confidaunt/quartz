Outside of the safe haven of cities, the Lupines roam. These shapeshifting beasts lie in wait to catch Kindred and tear them limb from limb. Every vampire these nights seems to have a story of a nightmarish Lupine encounter. They are a terrifying and infuriating threat. No one is ever sure where they come from, when they will strike, or why they even want to kill vampires in the first place. No one except you, that is. Unlike other Kindred, you have encountered the Lupines and lived to tell the tale. You know their secrets, and most importantly, how to use those secrets to keep your fellow vampires safe. You may have learned them by spying on a pack, from a rogue Lupine, or just surviving a traumatic event like the War of Chicago. Whatever the reason, when the wolves start howling, the Kindred turn to you first. LORE

• Huntsman: You’ve developed a keen eye for tracking Lupines, even when they’re pretending to be human. Once per session, you may receive three extra dice to any Mental test to pursue Lupines.

•• Tactician: A Lupine attack is one of the most terrifying experiences in a vampire’s unlife. You’ve lived through enough of them to keep a cool head and help your coterie fight back. When you and your allies use Teamwork (Vampire: The Masquerade p. 122) against Lupines, the group can always assist each other. Every character can contribute one die to the Teamwork roll, no matter what Skill the test requires.

••• Soldier: A werewolf’s ability for combat should never be underestimated. You know that more than anyone, but it won’t stop you from getting into the thick of it. When engaging you in Physical combat, a shifted Lupine only has a −2 damage modifier when using its claws and teeth.

•••• Trophy: You have slain a Lupine, and you have the evidence to prove it. This memento may be something like a fragment of the Lupine’s human skull, a scrap of their clothing with an insignia representing a Lupine faction, or the shattered remains of one of their prized weapons. Once per story, when you reveal this trophy to a werewolf, you may choose its initial reaction: Either it flees from you, or only targets you for Physical conflict. Revealing this trophy to Lupines for more than once per story initiates the same choice, but the Storyteller chooses the reaction instead.

••••• Ambassador: Your knowledge of werewolves is so great that you can parley with them. You’ve earned mutual respect from both the Kindred and the Lupines, and you can use that respect to establish alliances between the two. The alliances you form are tense and fleeting, but compared to the status quo of “kill on sight,” they’re a dramatic improvement. Whenever you try to heal the rift between individual vampires and werewolves, or stir the two to unite, you receive two extra dice to Social tests in pursuit of your goal. With sufficient effort and sacrifice, you may convince the Kindred and Lupines of a city to act as one to accomplish a task once per chronicle, with no roll necessary.
