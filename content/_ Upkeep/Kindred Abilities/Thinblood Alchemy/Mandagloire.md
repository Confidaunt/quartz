Also called “The Funk” by alchemists who copy and adjust the formula. The alchemist is able to make their blood emit a noxious gas that causes a rigid paralysis to mortals and supernatural creatures alike. 

Ingredients: The alchemist’s blood, phlegmatic blood, human fat, candle wax, ether, sesame oil, iron sulfate or verdigris, and borax. 

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: Tapping the athanor’s vein emits a pungent stench when spilled that fills a room (or a house on a critical win). Mortals who fail to resist enter a full-body paralysis state, a waking coma, for the rest of the scene. Supernatural creatures who fail feel the effects of rigor mortis: a two-dice penalty on all Physical rolls from intense cramping. Fixatio: The potion can be slipped into a drink or meal as a poison, or burned to act as a paralyzing fragrance, above. 

Duration: Three turns
