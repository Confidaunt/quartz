The alchemist secretes powerful, caustic bile from their pores and orifices, corroding metals, wood, and living tissue. The alchemist activating this ability may touch and manipulate the bile while not being affected by it. 

Ingredients: The alchemistâ€™s Blood, choleric blood, potash or lye, animal spleen, cheesecloth, and iodine. 

Activation Cost: One or two Rouse Checks 

System: When active, the power allows the alchemist to corrode any material in seconds by simply making contact with it and gains +2 damage on brawl attacks as their mere touch becomes acid. (As the alchemist controls how and where they excrete the acid their own clothes are usually unaffected.) The Storyteller is the final arbiter on the extent of damage caused but the acid is supernaturally strong and far more potent than that produced by Corrosive Vitae (see Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 273). The alchemist may make a second Rouse check to projectile vomit the bile as an attack (Strength + Alchemy during melee, Dexterity + Alchemy for a ranged spitting attack). On a win, the bile does the margin +3 in Superficial Health damage (Aggravated to mortals). Athanor Corporis or Calcinatio: The alchemist or vessel can only hold this formula after distillation for a week before they begin to look sickly: blue veins popping against their pale skin, and the skin itself sagging low on their bodies. After a month, the bile corrodes the Calcinatio vessel if not tapped. Fixatio: The container of the bile slowly corrodes, falling completely apart in Alchemy + 4 weeks. 

Duration: One scene
