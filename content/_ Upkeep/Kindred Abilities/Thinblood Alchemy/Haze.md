This formula creates a field of mist that follows the user, rendering them more difficult to target with ranged weapons and concealing their identity.     

Ingredients: In addition to the alchemistâ€™s Blood and phlegmatic human blood, dry ice or cigar smoke or auto exhaust     

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check     

System: Upon activation a cloud of mist-like vapor surrounds the alchemist, masking their features and obscuring their silhouette. Anyone attempting to identify the user or hit them with ranged weapons suffers a two-dice penalty to their pool. The user can extend the cloud to encompass a group of up to five people by making another Rouse check.     

Duration: One scene or until voluntarily ended.
