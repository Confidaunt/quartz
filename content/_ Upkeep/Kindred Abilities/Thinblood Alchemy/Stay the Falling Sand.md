Colloquially known as "Scab Dabs," this experimental formula enables the thin-blooded vampire to extend the frozen-in-time nature of the kindred condition, externally, for a short amount of time. While this ability has no effect on kindred, kine, or other living things, it can temporarily stave off disaster, preventing a binfull of dishes from falling to the floor, or halt the detonation of an explosive. 

Ingredients: The alchemist's blood, melancholic human blood, indica-dominant cannabis wax, juniper berries, a teaspoon of antifreeze.    

Activation Cost: One rouse check.  Dice Pool: Resolve + Alchemy    

System: This volatile mixture immediately begins to coagulate and thicken once exposed to the air, however it can be liquified or vaporized upon introduction to a heating element. The mixture may either be immediately consumed, or inhaled through vapor. There the substance remains dormant until activated with a rouse check. The alchemist may then make a resolve + Alchemy roll to, effectively, "Freeze Time" in a small, confined space(roughly 3x3x3 feet). This power has noe effect upon living creatures. The "Freeze" lasts only for a single combat round, allowing for just enough time for a target to get out of the way of a hail of gunfire, or halt falling debris. The Alchemist may maintain this hold for additional combat rounds by spending a point of Willpower and rerolling Resolve + Alchemy. The difficulty of this roll may vary depending upon the actions being halted (Difficulty 2 for a slowly lobbed grenade, 4 or higher for catching speeding bullets.)    

Duration: One round, or more if maintained. The power expires after one use.
