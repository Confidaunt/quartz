Prerequisite: Concoct Ashe By melting down a vampire’s possessions (the more important the better) during Ashe creation, an alchemist infuses the drug with memories from the destroyed vampire.   

Ingredients: A melted-down object belonging to the destroyed vampire.   

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check in addition to the cost of using Ashe   

System: When using Concoct Ashe, this formula may be used to imbue remains with the memories of the vampire they once formed. When consumed, this altered Ashe provokes a Willpower test at a Difficulty of 1 + the destroyed vampire’s Blood Potency. On a win the user immediately enters a Memoriam (see Vampire: The Masquerade p. 311), reliving an important memory of the destroyed vampire’s past rather than their own. This scene is resolved normally using their own stats, but the shifted perspective will be valuable. If they are meditating in a place of calm at the time they consume the Ashe, the thin-blood adds a one-die bonus to all dice pools during the Memoriam.
