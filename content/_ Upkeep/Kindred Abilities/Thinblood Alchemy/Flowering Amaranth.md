This form of shared diablerie draws virtue from the vitae of a full-blooded Kindred into the alchemist and their assistants. 

Ingredients: Blood from the alchemist and participating thin-bloods (up to three thin-bloods total), juice of red amaranth flowers from a plant fertilized with blood, pulverized leeches, hydrogen sulfide, and neon. 

Activation Cost: Everyone participating must roll one Rouse Check 

System: The alchemist and up to two other participants tie a silk cord around their wrists, connecting them in a triangle surrounding a fullblooded Kindred target, also so bound. The alchemist rolls Resolve + Alchemy; each additional thin-blood participant can add one die to the pool by spending 2 Willpower. If the full-blood resists, they use their Willpower pool + Blood Potency. On a win, the participating thin-bloods gain one dot in one of the targetâ€™s core clan Disciplines, determined randomly. (On a critical win, the alchemist can choose the Discipline.) They cannot learn or purchase this Discipline higher than the first dot, but in other respects can use it as though they were full-blooded Kindred. They do not gain generation, but still lose 1 Humanity and gain the black-veined aura of diablerie.
