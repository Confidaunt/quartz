This poison can be injected into a mortal’s bloodstream, dealing no damage to them (through the miracle of alchemical transformation) but inflicting considerable pain on a blankbody who feeds from them. Other variations create different effects: babbling incoherence (and inability to use some Disciplines), indifferent calm, etc.   

Ingredients: The Alchemist’s Blood, choleric human blood, foxglove, absinthe, laundry detergent or phosgene   

Activation Cost: One Rouse check   

System: The victim makes a contested Stamina + Resolve roll vs. the Alchemist’s Resolve + Alchemy (7 dice). If the victim wins, the serum has no effect. For every success the Alchemist wins by, the victim takes 2 levels of Aggravated damage.   

Duration: One day
