This formula, discovered by accident, turns any amount of spilled or drawn blood or vitae into a dangerous accelerant. This concoction is capable of turning blood-bags into Molotov cocktails, and an otherwise enticing feeding opportunity into a potential death trap.
   
Ingredients: The alchemist's blood, choleric human blood, 2m of canola oil, a dash of lemon juice, cayenne seasoning.    

System: Contrary to most formulas, this formula is not imbibed by the user, but added to inert or spilled blood. Adding it in any about of human blood or vampiric vitae creates a heavily flammable slurry. While this does not automatically cause the blood to combust, any introduction of flame to the spilled blood creates a slow-burning yet powerful inferno. This fire cannot be extinguished for the duration of the effect. Though fires spreading from it can. For each success gained from the Distillation roll, the alchemist creates one usage of this power.   -  

Duration: The formulas are preserved until used. The Bloodfire last for an entire scene or potentially longer depending on the surroundings.
