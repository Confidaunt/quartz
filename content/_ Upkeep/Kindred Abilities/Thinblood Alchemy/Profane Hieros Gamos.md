Alchemical texts speak of the Great Hermaphrodite, the union of contrasts. Day and night, male and female, life and death. Alchemists who master the worldly aspect of the Hieros Gamos use the fluid nature of their condition to change their gender. It is a messy process and requires great dedication and conviction, but it is a power that many Kindred secretly envy in their unchanging form. It is also a great way to change identity or adopt a new mask.     

Ingredients: The alchemistâ€™s Blood, blood from five different vessels identifying fully as the desired gender     

System: After brewing the formula, the Alchemist performs self-castration and / or mastectomy before falling into daysleep. Upon awakening they find themselves a perfectly formed specimen of the desired gender. In essence it is as if they had been born that way. There are even stories of selfmade Duskborn women giving birth to children. If desired, a modified procedure can create any configuration of gender or agender imaginable.     

Duration: Permanent until performed again.
