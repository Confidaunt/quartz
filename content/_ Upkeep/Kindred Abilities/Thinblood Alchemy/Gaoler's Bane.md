By Imbibing this formula, the alchemist enables their body to accomplish unbelievable feats of contortion and dislocation, allowing for escape from even the most cunning of physical restraints.

Ingredients: The alchemist's blood, sanguine human blood, two week's worth of contents of a regularly used grill's grease trap.    

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check.    

System: Upon activation this ability, the Alchemist can twist, ben or stretch their bodies in minor ways to free themselves from physical bonds or grapples. Dexterity + Larceny checks for the purpose of slipping one's self free of handcuffs, zip-ties, or other ligatures get a two-dice bonus. Additionally, any strength + brawl rolls made to escape a grapple also receive a two-dice bonus.    

Duration: One scene or until voluntarily ended.
