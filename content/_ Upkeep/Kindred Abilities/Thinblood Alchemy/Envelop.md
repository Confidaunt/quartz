This formula creates a mist that clings to a victim, blinding it and (in the case of mortals) causing suffocation.     

Ingredients: The alchemistâ€™s Blood, melancholic and phlegmatic human blood, potassium chlorate, smog or halon gas     

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check     

Dice Pools: Wits + Alchemy vs Stamina + Survival     

System: The alchemist activates the power and chooses a target within sight. A swirling mist envelops the target, obscuring their sight and penalizing them three dice from all sight-based detection and ranged attack dice pools. In addition, the alchemist can make the mist suffocate a mortal with a contest of Wits + Alchemy vs. Stamina + Survival. On a win, the target can take no action except coughing and choking; on a critical win, the target loses consciousness. The alchemist can only employ Envelop on single targets, and only on one at a time.     

Duration: Until scene ends or the alchemist ends the effect voluntarily.
