Prerequisite: Concoct Ashe 

Counterfeiting Disciplines is part and parcel of Thin-Blood Alchemy’s use, but the ability to channel a Discipline from the ashes of a deceased vampire is a form of necromantic Alchemy, at least according to Dr. Mortius and the Duskborn who practice it. Those who practice this Alchemy find themselves able to use any one of the destroyed vampire’s Discipline powers, even if they typically wouldn’t have access to powers of this level.   

Ingredients: Crushed leaves from the indigo plant.   

Activation Cost: The same as the channeled power.   

Dice Pools: The same as the channeled power.   

System: When using Concoct Ashe, this formula may be used to imbue remains with the abilities of the vampire they once formed. When consumed, this altered Ashe provokes a Willpower test at a Difficulty of the destroyed vampire’s highest Discipline rating. On a win, the thin-blood gains the use of a single Discipline power that the destroyed vampire possessed, until the end of the chapter. Use the destroyed vampire’s Discipline rating whenever a channeled power calls for one. The Storyteller may state the Disciplines and specific powers the deceased vampire held so the alchemist can choose from a list, or if the alchemist has a power in mind they can request it from the Storyteller. The Storyteller has final say. On a critical win the thin-blood gains the use of two Discipline powers that the destroyed vampire possessed.
