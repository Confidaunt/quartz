More accurately described as "poison" rather than "potion," this formula provokes the Beast's appetite and allows for no placation. Vampires who unknowingly consume this mixture find that no amount of feeding slakes their hunger. Bagged blood, animal blood, human blood, and even the Vitae of Elders are as malnourishing as water to the vampire.

Ingredients: The alchemist's blood, non-resonant human blood, five powderized tablets of aspirin, rotten eggs or powdered sulfur.   Dice Pool: Intelligence + Alchemy vs Stamina + Composure    

System: By tricking, forcing, or otherwise coercing the victim to imbibe this formula, the alchemist then conducts an Intelligence + Alchemy roll against the intended victim's  Stamina + Composure. A success indicates that the poison has taken hold, and will remain in the victim's system for an entire night or until their internal reserves of vitae have been completely exhausted. Additional margin's of success increases the Victim's current hunger (one rank per every two additional successes.) Until the poison runs it's course, no amount of feeding (including the blood consumed with the poison) will slake the victim's hunger.     

Duration: One night, or until the victim suffers a hunger frenzy.
