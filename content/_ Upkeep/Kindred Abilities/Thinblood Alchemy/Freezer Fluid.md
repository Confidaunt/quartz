When ingested by or injected into a blankbody, this serum freezes their limbs, making them clumsy and possibly even helpless. Wood absorbs it; plastic remains inert; it sublimes rapidly from metal. Hunters either covertly inject it into their targets or soak their stakes in it. Targets get a Wits + Awareness roll to avoid drinking it in a beverage (Difficulty 2 for non-foaming beverages; Difficulty 3 for beer).   

Ingredients: The Alchemist’s Blood, melancholy and phlegmatic human blood, echinacea, possum scent glands, local anaesthetic or ricin   

Activation Cost: One Rouse check   

System: The victim makes a Contested Stamina + Resolve roll vs the Alchemist’s Resolve + Alchemy (7 dice). If the victim wins, the serum has no effect. For every success the Alchemist wins by, the victim loses 2 dice from all physical dice pools.   

Duration: One scene
