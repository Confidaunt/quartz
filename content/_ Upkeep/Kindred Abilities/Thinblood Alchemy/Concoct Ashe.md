The process of creating the Ashe drug is a form of Blood Alchemy in itself, and generally takes place in a laboratory or workshop due to the need for an open flame and metal filings.   

Ingredients: A destroyed vampire’s ashes, an open flame reaching 1,500°C, aluminum filings.   

Dice Pools: Intelligence + Thin-Blood Alchemy   

System: The vampire’s ashes are contained in a vessel heated by an open flame and then mixed with aluminum filings. Each success on the distillation roll produces a single Ashe dose. On a total failure, the sample is ruined and a Beast Shard (see p. XX) emerges in the area. When consumed, all Ashe allows a thin-blood to access more of the power in vitae and ash than is usually within their grasp. Their Blood Potency counts as 1 for the purposes of Blood Surges and Discipline Rouse Check re-rolls until the end of the chapter. The drug is far from lacking in downsides however, see Ashe Addiction (see p. XX).
