Alchemists frequently use this formula during negotiations to try and sway at least one person to their side; however, it can be easy to spot if anyone is paying close enough attention. Rumor allows the alchemist to make a statement and convince one person to agree with them on that statement. 

Ingredients: The alchemist’s blood, phlegmatic blood, pepper, oil, and graphite or mercury. 

Activation Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: Upon activation, the alchemist makes a statement and invites the target to agree, e.g. “I heard you plan to invest in the new mortuary downtown. Is that true?” On a win, the target agrees and continues to believe they agreed to the statement of their own free will. To get the target to actually act on their agreement (e.g., sign investment papers) usually requires a further Manipulation + Subterfuge (or similar) contest, but the alchemist can add their margin on the Alchemy contest to their pool in that contest. 

Duration: One scene, and thereafter until something (or someone) persuasively contradicts the target’s agreement (“I would never have agreed to that! I must have been drugged!”).
