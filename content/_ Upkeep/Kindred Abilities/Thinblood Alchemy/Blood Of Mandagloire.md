This concoction can taint an entire herd, but must be imbibed by the victims within a few hours of being distilled.   

Ingredients: The Alchemist’s Blood, melancholic human blood, ketamine or Thorazine, melted human fat, verdigris   

Activation Cost: One Rouse check   

System: After taking this concoction the herd takes on a melancholic Resonance and becomes sluggish and unresponsive. Any vampire feeding off of them while they’re in this state must make a Composure + Resolve roll against a Difficulty equal to the cooker’s Alchemy or fall into a dreamless sleep for an hour. Aggressive shaking or slapping gives the vampire another roll to resist the stupor, while inflicting a wound awakens them immediately though the melancholy Resonance lingers.   

Duration: This formula stays active in the herd’s blood for three nights after dosing.
