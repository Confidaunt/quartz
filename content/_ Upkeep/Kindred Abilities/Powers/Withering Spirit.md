This power channels raw entropy via rapid spiritual decay, affecting vampires as well as kine by targeting the victim’s spirit. A vampire using this power risks Stains, as it can completely obliterate the victim’s spirit, preventing return as a wraith. 

Cost: Two Rouse Checks, Stains (variable amount) 

Dice Pools: Resolve + Oblivion vs. Resolve + Occult or Fortitude 

System: The vampire makes two Rouse Checks to expend sufficient vitae to coat both hands, and touches the victim. After rolling Resolve + Oblivion vs. the victim’s Resolve + Occult (Those with Fortitude may use it in place of Occult), the victim suffers two Aggravated Willpower damage for each point of the vampire’s margin. The attack erodes the victim’s spirit until they’re a broken husk, and if Impaired by this power they will not return as a wraith after death. Storytellers may decide that the spirit-destroying nature of this power warrants Stains, though as always, an appropriate Conviction may mitigate these. 

Duration: One turn
