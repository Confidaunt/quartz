lingering kiss The Kiss of a vampire induces near-ecstasy in mortals, but this power leaves other Kisses in the dust. Mortals fed upon by the user become addicted to the Kiss, obsessing over it and even seeking the vampire out for repeated feedings. Mortals often become anemic, self-harm, or even die from this addiction, but vampires find it a useful power for cultivating a herd.   

Cost: Free   

System: The vampire can choose to use this power or not during each feeding. The user adds dice equal to their Presence to any subsequent Charisma Attribute-assisted pool against the bitten subject. A mortal fed upon with this power can make a Willpower test (Difficulty equals the userâ€™s Presence) every week to resist the effects. Winning this test for three consecutive weeks breaks the effect, as does a single critical win.   

Duration: Until successfully resisted
