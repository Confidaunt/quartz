Though the Discipline of Fortitude allows a Kindred to resist damage from bullets, blades, and even burning fire and sunlight. It does little, however, to keep the forces of physics at bay and an overwhelming blow can still stagger or knock prone the unprepared vampire. By shoring up their physical hardlines with vampiric Potence, the Kindred may maintain steady footing when struck by a massive force. 

Amalgam: Potence 2

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Wits + Survival 

System: When activated, a vampire may use this power to become sturdy and strong immovable object. Vampires falling from great heights find themselves literally able to hit the ground running. Vampires struck by moving vehicles don't budget an inch while the car crumples like aluminum. Users may consciously activate this ability in advance or may instinctively activate it my making a successful Stamina + Survival check at Difficulty 3. Any superficial damage received from falling or collisions is reduced by the user's Fortitude score, before being halved.  

Duration: One Scene.
