A favored power of the Roses, with this ability, the user may sublimate and infuse the powers of the blood into their works of art - capable of rendering sculptures so beautiful as to make the viewer fall in love with them, or painting of such ghastly disquiet they make even the most visceral Caravaggio seem facile by comparison. This masterwork is merely an illusion, however - a flash-in-the-pan beauty that does not withstand deep scrutiny. 

Amalgam: Auspex 3

Cost: One or more Rouse Checks 

Dice Pools: Charisma, Manipulation + Crafts 

System: Before embarking on a Project Roll to create a work of art the user must make One Rouse Check for each roll made. The difficulty of the project must be 10 or higher. Upon successful completion of the project, the user find that residual traces of their Presence lingers within the work itself. When your artwork is on display, audiences must roll Composure + Resolve (Difficulty equal to the user's Presence rank) or succumb to the rough equivalent of either Awe or Daunt exuding from the piece. A Critical Success on the resistance roll renders the subject immune to further influence by the piece. Note: By integration Disciplines into its creation, the work of art has no true staying power aside from the initial exposure. Critics and observers may find themselves suddenly able to critique flaws or imperfections once they have left the immediate area.
