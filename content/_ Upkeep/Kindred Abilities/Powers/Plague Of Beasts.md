The vampire can mark an individual, making them
the target of focused animal attention. Whatever beasts or vermin are in the area seek the target out to bark, peck, scratch, and generally make their night miserable. While the animals retain enough instincts to not entirely threaten their self-preservation, they make it very hard for the victim to do anything but fend them off. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Manipulation + Animalism vs Composure + Animal Ken 

System: The vampire picks a target within their line of sight and tests Manipulation + Animalism against the target’s Composure + Animal Ken. On a win the target becomes the focus of attention for all animals in their vicinity for the rest of the night, suffering a dice penalty to all Skill pools equal to the margin on the win unless they can physically isolate themselves from the local wildlife. The target also becomes easier to track, with any pursuer receiving a bonus equal to the same margin. The Skill penalty does not apply to physical conflicts, as the animals aren’t suicidal enough to stick around when fists and bullets start flying, though they return once the dust settles. 

Duration: One night
