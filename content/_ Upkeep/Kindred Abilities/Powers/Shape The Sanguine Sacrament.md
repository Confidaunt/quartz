Learned only by the most ostentatious of Tremere, this power is used to manipulate blood or vitae into finely crafted images - whether entertaining your fellows at Elysium with gaudy magician's tricks or diverting flowing rivulets into painstakingly precise Hermetic sigils.

Cost: Free (or One Rouse Check if using own Blood) Dice Pool: Manipulation + Blood Sorcery 

System: Using a measure of blood or vampiric vitae, the user may channel their mastery of Blood Sorcery to influence the very essence of the blood itself, to obey the user's whim. By making a successful Manipulation + Blood Sorcery roll, the user may craft the blood into any shape or image they desire. Complexity of the image varies by difficulty - a simple message of "Help!" or a basic polygonal shape may only be at Difficulty 2, while a lengthy diatribe or an intricate sculpture may be Difficulty 4 or higher. Failure on this roll means the blood fails to for the desired shape or does not respond at all - a Critical Success not only forms the desired image, but negates the need for any further rolls to change its shape for the duration of the scene. 

Duration: For the remainder of the scene, unless dispelled by the user.
