Kindred are creatures of cruel irony, and the name of this Discipline power is one such example. While conditioned with the Domitor’s Favor, a thrall with a Blood Bond to that vampire finds it much more difficult to act against their master. Domineering Tzimisce especially relish this power, using it to ensure the loyalty of their servants. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: Defiance rolls for willful thralls under the effects of Domitor’s Favor are made at a three-dice penalty and thralls may not spend Willpower on them. Additionally, total failure on a defiance roll means that the Blood Bond does not weaken that month. (See Vampire: The Masquerade, pp. 233–244.) 

Duration: One month
