Amalgam: Dominate 3 

Prerequisite: Panacea 

As seekers of the promises of Golconda, some vampires explore ways to remedy the turbulent souls of their fellow Damned. This power shares some amount of the vampire’s moral serenity with a repentant Kindred, allowing some semblance of remorse to be restored while also keeping the Beast at bay. It does require the user to take on part of the mind and spirit of their subject, shackling their will to that of the user. (Most often seen among the Salubri, this power has no doubt contributed to their reputation as monstrous soul-thieves.) 

Cost: Two Rouse Checks, gain one Stain Dice Pool: Composure + Auspex vs. Humanity 

System: The vampire spends a scene in seclusion with the subject and rolls Composure + Auspex vs. the Humanity of the subject. For every success in the margin, they can remove one Stain from the subject, or erect a psychological “shield” that protects the subject from future Stains on a one-for-one basis. For example, a margin of three applied to a subject with no Stains would effectively “cancel out” up to three Stains acquired later in the session. On a critical win the user can choose to forgo the above benefits, instead restoring a single point of Humanity to the subject, but no vampire can gain that benefit more than once, ever. Unburdening the Bestial Soul works only on vampires, and automatically fails if the subject has a higher Humanity than the user. No matter the benefits received, for the rest of the session the subject is numbed, having part of their mind merged with the user, and any Dominate powers used on them by this power’s user succeed automatically with no eye contact necessary. When the power expires, all psychological “shields” not used up are lost, though Stains removed or Humanity gained on initial application do not revert. 

Duration: One session
