Amalgam: Dominate 2 The vampire can craft the illusion of a completely different persona, hiding their true thoughts and feelings to anyone who uses supernatural abilities to read their mental state, aura, thoughts, or similar. Those who look into their mind see only what the user wants them to see, and only the most accomplished scryers can pierce this elaborate facade. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Intelligence + Obfuscate 

System: The user rolls Intelligence + Obfuscate against a Difficulty of 1 to 3 (or more), depending on the sophistication of the ruse they want to enact, with 1 representing a simple masking of their emotional state to 3 and beyond for elaborate alternate personas complete with false thoughts and memories. The margin on the win is added as Difficulty to any attempt to “read” them. Failing to reach the added Difficulty lets the reader see only the false personality the user has crafted, without any hint that the reader is being misled. (Failing to VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE PLAYERS GUIDE 7 9 reach even the standard Difficulty yields nothing, as normal, so as not to let on that a false personality is present.) 

Duration: One scene
