The vampire gives independent life to a part of their shadow and can use it to spy on or unnerve their enemies. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: The servant has no mind of its own, but follows its creator’s mental commands The shadow travels at running speed and can effortlessly slip under doors, climb walls, or slip into or through the smallest cracks, although it cannot endure brightly lit areas. It can also cling to moving vehicles, and its range is limited only by how far it can travel in one night. It hears and sees everything in its vicinity and can convey the information as soon as it is reabsorbed into its creator’s shadow. The shadow servant can only be banished by bright light, such as from a powerful torch or daylight, but a successful Wits + Oblivion roll against Difficulty 3 allows the servant to avoid the light for a turn. 

Duration: One scene
