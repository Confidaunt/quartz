Amalgam: Dominate 2 

Prerequisite: Vicissitude Extending their mastery over flesh, the vampire can inflict their ministrations on the bodies of others. The power is rightly feared, as many of its users have a reputation for inhuman torture, though some employ it to great effect to enhance and adapt their servants and allies. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: In order to use this power, the user must be able to work undisturbed on the subject, who thus either needs to be willing or restrained. For a willing subject, follow the same system as Vicissitude (above). An unwilling subject can resist with their Stamina + Resolve, with the user’s margin counting as Vicissitude successes. Each use of this power takes a full scene to perform. Again, the total number of changes cannot exceed the user’s Protean rating, no matter the number of applications or successes. In case of multiple users working on a single subject, only count the highest Protean rating. Changes can be mended as Aggravated damage, with each change equivalent to a single level of damage. (Mortals thus require extensive surgery.) 

Duration: Permanent
