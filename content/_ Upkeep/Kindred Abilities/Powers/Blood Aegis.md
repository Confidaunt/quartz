The vampire can will their vitae to form a physical protective barrier. The barrier manifests as a quivering sheet of Blood, the fluid moving of its own accord to intercept and catch incoming projectiles. 

Cost: One or more Rouse Checks 

System: The user expends Blood equal to one or more Rouse Checks. For each Check the floating barrier can reduce damage from incoming ranged attacks by five. The effect is automatic as the vitae intercepts each incoming projectile in a shower of Blood, only to reform as long as the power remains active. Once the protection is spent the Blood turns inert as it lies splattered over the zone of conflict. 

Duration: One scene or until damage levels are spent, whichever comes first.
