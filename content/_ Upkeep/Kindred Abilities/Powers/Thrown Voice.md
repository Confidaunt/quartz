The vampire can cause their voice to emanate from any point within sight, whether as a whisper or shout. The voice is audible as if the vampire was standing in that spot and can be heard by anyone within earshot, depending on strength. The voice can also be left in a location, continuing to lure or terrify those who stray, depending on the power used. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: No roll is required, apart from the Rouse Check. If using this power in combination with Irresistible Voice, Melpominee, or similar powers, they must roll as usual.
