While present in a building or similar locale the vampire is able to extend the powers of Awe, Daunt, and Majesty through the very structure of the building. Anybody in the building or looking at it will be affected by these powers, reacting to the building as if the vampire themself is present. 

Cost: N/A 

System: Anyone seeing the building from outside or who are present inside it needs to resist the power used as if the vampire was present, unless the vampire is within eyesight, at which point they themselves becomes the focus. As a building does not generally make Skill checks, apply the bonuses instead to any reaction the victim has to the place. A nightclub under the influence of Awe will have queues stretching around the block, while a haven under Daunt will turn away all but the most staunch investigators. Use of Majesty has to be done with extreme caution, as the results can be spectacular and volatile, far exceeding the effect of the more subtle powers. 

Duration: As power transmitted
