When a fist hits concrete, it’s usually the fist that breaks. So it is with this power, where a vampire turns a chapter two: Kindred Religions blow against the one delivering it. This power has been known to break weapons and shatter bones. 

Requirement: Toughness

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Stamina + Fortitude vs. Stamina (+ Fortitude, if the attacker is attacking unarmed and possesses Fortitude) 

System: Anyone who makes a successful Brawl attack against the user suffers the damage which Toughness subtracts (see Vampire: The Masquerade p. 258) as Superficial Health damage. Melee weapons also suffer reflected damage, and break once they endure their damage modifier’s worth (unless it is holy, magical, or otherwise unbreakable). This power may only be used while Toughness is active, and can be used in response to an attack so long as the vampire has yet to use a Discipline during the current turn. 

Duration: One scene (or until hit)
