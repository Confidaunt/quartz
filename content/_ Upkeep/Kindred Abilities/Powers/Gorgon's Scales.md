The Resonance of the blood in the vampire’s system grants them various defenses against the powers of other Kindred, or protects them from common vampire weaknesses. Finding the right vessel to respond to an immediate defensive requirement is not always easy, but especially callous vampires have been known to keep vessels with different Resonances in ready supply, using elaborate manipulative schemes or plain drugs to keep their emotions vivid and ready to tap. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: On activation the vampire gains a set of immunities or resistances dependent on the Resonance of the blood they most recently fed upon.  Choleric: A stake driven through the vampire’s heart is consumed with decay or turns to ash at the end of the scene, immediately freeing the vampire from paralysis. The Resonance is then lost.  Melancholy: Aggravated Health damage caused by fire is reduced to Superficial. The Resonance is lost after reducing four levels of damage.  Phlegmatic: The vampire gains a four-dice bonus to resist Auspex powers that would reveal anything about them or what they know. Once the power is activated it lasts for a scene, at which point the Resonance is lost.  Sanguine: Aggravated Health damage caused by sunlight is reduced to Superficial. The Resonance is lost after reducing four levels of damage. 

Duration: Until the scene ends or the Resonance is lost, whichever comes first. Obfuscate Level 2
