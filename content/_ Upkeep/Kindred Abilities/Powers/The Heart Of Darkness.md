Practiced almost exclusively by vampires within the higher echelons of the Church of Set, this power enables a vampire to remove their own heart and store it outside their body. The vampire’s flesh and bone warp as they reach their hand into their bare chest without the need for incision, after which point, they remove the heart. This power is not without risk to the practitioner, and can only be used by a vampire on themselves. The vampire typically places the heart in a ceremonial canopic jar or urn, though there is no restriction as to where the heart can go. Many cult-minded Kindred take advantage of the fact the organ can retain vitae, and even slake their Hunger from afar, by receiving ritualistic blood donations. For as long as it is removed, the vampire is immune to staking attempts, unless a stake is driven through the removed heart. The vampire’s emotions are detached — metaphysically and biologically, if the heart can be said to be the font of emotion — providing them a resilience against their Beast’s urges but a remove from compassion and warmth. 

Amalgam: Fortitude 2

System: This power requires no roll, but inflicts two Aggravated Health damage to the vampire when removing their heart. No powers can be used to mitigate this damage, and reattaching the heart requires two Rouse Checks. Once removed the vampire gains a two-dice bonus to resist frenzy, but suffers a two-die penalty on Remorse rolls. If the heart is dealt Aggravated Health damage equal to or greater than the vampire’s Health, they fall into torpor. If an extracted heart is destroyed — only possible with fire or sunlight — the vampire experiences final death. While the heart is removed, the vampire’s body cannot be staked unless the heart is located and separately impaled, in which case the vampire falls paralyzed. If blood is fed to the heart, it will slake the vampire’s Hunger as normal (even Blood Bonding them if fed Kindred vitae from the vein), and the heart can be fed from in the same way — possibly leading to diablerie. The vampire is still susceptible to death via fire or sunlight even without a heart. 

Duration: Permanent (or until the heart is destroyed/returned)
