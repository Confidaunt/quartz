The mind-numbing fear of realizing one’s role as prey is unique, and vampires versed in sensing the Beast can learn to recognize it in those who experience it. This power allows a vampire to become aware of any mortal in an area projecting the distinct note of fear produced by prey animals having come face to face with their predator, allowing them to quickly track and silence those who would threaten their clandestine presence. 

Cost: One Rouse Check Dice Pool: Resolve + Animalism 

System: The vampire sniffs the air and rolls Resolve + Animalism. Each success on the roll allows them to sense and track the position of a mortal who has witnessed what a Camarilla Kindred would call a “Masquerade violation.” (The user senses the closest mortal first if there are more than one and order matters.) The effect lasts for one scene, or one night on a critical win. The power is ineffective on mortals who are familiar enough with vampires to sublimate the note of fear, such as ghouls, vampire retainers, or dedicated hunters. 

Duration: One scene or night
