Vampires with an affinity for Oblivion can sense locations where the Shroud between the world of the living and the Shadowlands thins. Though this Discipline doesn’t directly tell a vampire why the Shroud between worlds is thin in a certain place, it may be due to a grisly murder that took place there many years before, or because necromancers have frequently used the location to summon spirits, or it might be a location of holy or unholy resonance, among other reasons. In locations where the Shroud is thinnest, mortal health suffers and use of the Oblivion Discipline becomes easier, if the vampire knows how to harness the gap in the Shroud. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Wits + Oblivion 

System: Following a Rouse Check, the player rolls Wits + Oblivion (Difficulty 3) and on a win may determine the density of the Shroud in their nearby area, as large as an entire building or landmark. On a critical win, this roll reveals whether the Shroud’s density recently changed. On a total failure, the power backfires and gives a false reading. Without use of this power, Oblivion users cannot benefit from a thinning of the Shroud. The following table expresses the different degrees of Shroud density, and the effects they have: SHROUD DENSITY POSSIBLE CAUSE EFFECT Impenetrable No deaths took place here, consecrated land Vampires and wraiths cannot cross the Shroud here Thick Long ago a death took place here, a place of joy No effect Thin A death recently took place here, melancholic mortals often pass through this place −1 Difficulty on Oblivion rolls SHROUD DENSITY POSSIBLE CAUSE EFFECT Frayed A series of deaths took place here, necromancers often enact Ceremonies here −2 Difficulty on Oblivion rolls Absent A necromancer used Split the Shroud (p.XX) here, spectres regularly pass through this part of the Shroud −2 Difficulty on Oblivion rolls, wraiths can freely pass to and from the Shadowlands, mortals suffer two Superficial Health damage in this area that cannot be healed until they depart
