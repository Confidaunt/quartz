The vampire can perform time-consuming tasks with blinding speed, their fingers and hands blurring as they write, repair, or build things in record time. While the concentration required prohibits them from employing this speed on the offense, it does allow them to achieve non-violent ends faster when under duress or outright attack. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: N/A 

System: When active, this power lets the vampire complete Skill-related tasks that would otherwise take whole turns in the span of a few seconds, and can treat a full action as a minor action (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 298). The power cannot be used to speed up attacks, defenses, or to perform any other actively resisted task but it does allow the vampire to, for example, jimmy a lock and fire a gun (the latter with a two-dice penalty, as per the minor action rules.) 

Duration: One scene
