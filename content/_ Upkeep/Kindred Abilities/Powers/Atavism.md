By subtly projecting their Beast into mortal animals, the vampire may cause it to revert to its most base and primal of instincts. Loyal guard dogs suddenly become ravenous, slathering curs and prized thoroughbreds throw their riders as they champ and buck in mad panic.

Cost: One Rouse Check. 

System: The target must be able to sense(smell, hear, or see) the user in question to use this power. Roll Composure + Animalism vs Difficulty 1-4, depending on type of animal, its training, and whether or not it is a ghoul. A win against the target allows the user to choose one of two primal responses. Fight or Flight. If Fight is chosen, the creature reacts in kind, lashing out at the closest perceived threat or prey. If Flight, the creature instead flies into a panic, trying to escape its surrounding at any cost to their safety. Well-trained and faithful animals tend to shake off this reaction quickly, and so, clever users ten to time their uses of this power in order to create maximum effect. 

Duration: A number of round equal to the test margin plus one, or the entire Scene in the case of a critical win.
