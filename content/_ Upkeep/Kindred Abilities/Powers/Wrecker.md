The vampire is able to exert violent, indiscriminate force on a static object in order to shatter, smash, and destroy it. While the lead-up time to summon this strength makes the ability useless in a fight, it comes in handy whenever a door bars the way, a car needs immobilizing, or an example needs to be made of an offending statue. 

Cost: Free 

System: The user counts their Potence rating twice when using Prowess for feats of strength that involve damage or destruction of an inanimate object. 

Duration: As Prowess
