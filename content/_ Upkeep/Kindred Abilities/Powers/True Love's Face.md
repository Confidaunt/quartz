Using a potent cocktail of concentrated emotion and illusions, the vampire can alter a mortal’s blood resonance or even risk a vampire’s connection to Humanity. The victim (and only the victim) perceives the vampire as a mortal they hold strong emotional ties with (such as hate for a rival, passion for a new lover, or the complicated feelings a vampire holds for their Touchstone).

Dice Pools: Manipulation + Presence vs. Composure + Wits 

System: To impersonate someone the victim has strong emotions for, the vampire must know their appearance and what the victim feels for them. How they uncover this will vary between vampires. When activated the Storyteller rolls a hidden contest between the user’s Manipulation + Presence and the victim’s Composure + Wits, where failure means the visage holds no emotional charge, which is deeply uncanny and sours any social interaction with the victim. It also prevents them from falling victim to this power for the rest of the story. On a win, the vampire adds their Presence rating to any rolls for affecting a mortal’s resonance or a vampire’s emotional state. Appearing as a vampire’s Touchstone is a dangerous game, especially if the victim possesses Sense the Unseen (see Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 249), but played right it can lead to Stains for the victim as their Touchstone appears to become damaged or detached entirely through shifts in behavior, ideals, or even apparent death.
