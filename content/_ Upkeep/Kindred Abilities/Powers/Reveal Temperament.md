The vampire can smell the Resonance of the target, as well as any Dyscrasia they harbor in their blood. They can also smell if another vampire has recently fed as well as the Resonance (if any) of their latest victim. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Intelligence + Auspex vs Composure + Subterfuge 

System: When the power is active the user can test Intelligence + Auspex vs a targetâ€™s Composure + Subterfuge. A win reveals the Resonance of the mortal observed as well as any other particulars of their blood, such as Dyscrasias. On a critical win the user also gains a two-dice bonus to interaction with the target for the duration of the scene as they are able to adapt their approach to the emotional state of the mortal. Versus a vampire, a win reveals the Resonance of the last mortal they fed upon, and a critical win provides a more nuanced picture of the vessel at time of feeding, revealing the method and Predator Type of the vampire. 

Duration: One scene
