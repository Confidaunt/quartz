Through rigorous discipline and training, this individual has learned to exert their will to stave off the call of the Hunger for a short time. By concentrating on the death of desire, they force the Beast to subside, enabling them to ignore its insatiable demands. Doing so is a gamble, as it can increase a vampire’s Hunger in the attempt. 

Cost: Two Rouse Checks 

System: At any time during a scene, the vampire may make two Rouse Checks, and if their Hunger doesn’t increase, they can ignore the effects of Hunger for the remainder of the scene. Doing this reduces all dice pools by a number equal to half (rounded up) of their current Hunger rating. If their Hunger increases by any other means during this time, their dice pools reduce by an additional die. If a dice pool reduces to zero through the use of this power, the character must roll to resist a fury frenzy, as stifling their Hunger intensifies the Beast’s rage. 

Duration: One scene
