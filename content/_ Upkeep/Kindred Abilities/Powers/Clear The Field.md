Presence 3, Dominate 3

A Kindred developed this Amalgam to clear a battlefield of weak foes, as she found no honor in killing them. In the modern era, it is used more often to clear a room of people so a kindred may enjoy solitude.

COST: One Rouse check

SYSTEM: This roll is Difficulty 3 for mortals and ghouls, and opposed individually by Wits + Composure by other vampires. The user can select a number of people equal to her Composure to be exempt from the effect. Everyone else clears a space equal to a large room around the Kindred, in a calm and orderly manner.
