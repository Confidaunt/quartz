Amalgam: Oblivion 1 

Everything breaks, and the vampire using this power can see the signs before they happen. By observing the subtle work of entropy the vampire can glean the Achilles’ heel of a target, whether it is a crack in their mental facade or a weakness in their actual armor. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: The user spends a turn intently observing the target, looking for a flaw in their defenses, and tests Intelligence + Auspex against the target’s Composure (for mental weaknesses) or Stamina (for physical ones) + Subterfuge. A win shows how they best attack their target, revealing the lowest defense pool in either category, and provides a two dice bonus to attacks against that pool. If the user informs anyone about said weakness they gain a one-die bonus. 

Duration: One scene
