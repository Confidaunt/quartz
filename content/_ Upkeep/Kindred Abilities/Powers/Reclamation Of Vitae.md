No matter the distance, Blood calls to Blood. Working on that principle, this power allows a vampire to reclaim Blood that has been yielded to create ghouls, reclaiming that which has been given. Regardless of where they are, ghouls of the vampire will find the life-giving vitae in their veins rebelling within them, returning through mystical means to its source, while their bodies suffer catastrophic damage. Sabbat elders have been known to keep ghouls for this express purpose, an emergency reserve available anywhere at any time, at the trifling cost of a few mortal lives. 

Cost: One or more Stains (when called to return) Dice Pool: None 

System: The user concentrates for a turn and choses which of their servants are to repay their Blooddebt. The ghouls do not need to be present, and distance doesnâ€™t matter. The vampire sates two Hunger for each ghoul, while the ghoul suffers five levels of aggravated damage as their body ages irregularly and rapidly, the undead Blood inside them feeling as if it were attempting to violently vacate them. While the power does not require the vampire to Rouse the Blood it should, if ever learned by someone outside the Sabbat, merit Stains to employ. 

Duration: N/A
