Amalgam: Blood Sorcery 3 

Vampires of great age and potency find it possible to exert their will via the Blood, without the traditional need for eye contact and verbal communication with their target. This power enables a Kindred to compel a descendant to take an action on their behalf, even if it’s one the target would normally be opposed to. Vampires instinctively know an ancestor is manipulating them, when subject to this power. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

Dice Pools: Manipulation + Dominate vs. Intelligence + Resolve 

System: On a successful roll of Manipulation + Dominate, the victim acts to fulfill the dominating vampire’s request, providing it doesn’t entail harming themself. For every generation beyond the first one separating the user of this power from their target, the resisting vampire gains an additional die to their roll. For example, when a Fifth Generation vampire attempts to use this power on a Seventh Generation descendant, the Seventh Generation descendant gains one die in defense. An Eighth Generation descendant would gain two dice. If the number of dice in the resisting vampire’s pool would exceed ten, the power automatically fails. On a total failure, the vampire cannot use this power on that target for the remainder of the chapter. 

Duration: Whichever comes sooner: until the compelled action is taken or the scene ends.
