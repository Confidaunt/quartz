Prerequisite: Blink

Amalgam: Obfuscate 4 

This lethal power not only allows the vampire to vanish from plain sight but to instantly move to an enemy and deliver a fatal strike. A vampire skilled in this art can quickly turn the tables as they disappear in front of pursuers, escaping not only with their lives but with that of their prey as well. 

Cost: Two Rouse Checks 

System: This power combines effects of Blink with elements of the Obfuscate power of Vanish. To onlookers the vampire appears to disappear and the target is caught unawares, becoming subject to surprise attack. Unless the victim can react by beating the userâ€™s Dexterity + Celerity with their Wits + Awareness in a contest, they are unable to defend against the attack and it is made against a set Difficulty of 1. (See Surprise Attacks in Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 300). If the attacker fails this test they still perform a regular attack, as per Blink power (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 253), and Unseen Strike is also subject to the same movement restrictions as Blink. 

Duration: One turn
