The Blood of the vampire becomes saturated with the power of Fortitude, conveying a part of that power to anyone who drinks of it. This is the Fortitude equivalent of Draught of Elegance (p. 254).   

Cost: One Rouse Check   

System: Drinking a Rouse Check's worth of Blood directly from the user gifts the drinker with temporary Fortitude equal to half the Fortitude dots (rounded down) of the donor. The drinker gains the same powers as the donorâ€™s, up to that level.   

Duration: One night; for vampires, until the next feeding or the vampire reaches Hunger 5
