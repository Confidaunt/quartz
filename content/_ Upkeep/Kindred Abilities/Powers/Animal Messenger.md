Amalgam: Auspex 1

The vampire’s Famulus can carry a short message to a person designated by its master, assuming they can reach them. Those within earshot hear the message as if the Famulus was speaking with their master’s voice. 

Cost: One Rouse Check for each night. 

Dice Pools: None, though the Famulus must test Resolve + Streetwise / Survival (or equivalent) if the target’s location is unknown. 

System: The vampire whispers a single sentence to the Famulus and states the target. If the location of the recipient is unknown the Famulus must track them down, making a tracking test (see above) at a Difficulty of 2, or resisted by the target’s Intelligence + Streetwise / Survival if they are actively trying to hide (from the famulus or from other perceived threats). The attempt can be made once per night. The message is delivered as soon as the Famulus makes eye contact with the target, at which point they return to their master. 

Duration: One or more nights depending in length of search
