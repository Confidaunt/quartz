A vampire with this power is almost impossible to move when it is active. The vampire draws upon the strength of the earth, grounding themselves and drawing upon its permanence to keep them rooted in place. 

Cost: One Rouse check 

System: When this power is activated, the only way the vampire moves is if they choose to do so independently. This doesn’t make them resistant to damage, and a vampire can still be crushed, ripped apart, or torn to shreds, as can the floor they’re standing on. 

Duration: One scene or until lapsed by user
