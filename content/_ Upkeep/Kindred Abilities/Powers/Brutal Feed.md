Known as the “Savage Kiss”, this power allows the user to employ an unholy inner strength when draining a victim. In mere seconds, the attacker swallows torrents of blood while mauling the victim. The result is an efficient, if messy, feeding often employed in the heat of battle where the mangled remains of the victim can be disguised.   

Cost: Free.   

System: The vampire can drain a human completely in seconds, usually within a single turn. Every point of Hunger slaked causes one point of Aggravated Health damage to the victim, as their blood vessels burst and organs bruise and rupture internally. Using Brutal Feed on a vampire does only Superficial Health damage to their dead and inert organs. In combat, Brutal Feed comes immediately after a successful Brawl attack using fangs. The victim first takes bite damage, then damage from this power. Armor does not protect against Brutal Feed, as the wounds are, or at least begin as, mainly internal. Storytellers may decide such mutilation-killing warrants Stains (p. 239).   

Duration: One feeding
