Amalgam: Fortitude 1 The vampire soothes the mental or emotional turmoil of their subject, restoring to them a modicum of steadfastness. It is especially effective when used on mortals, either to help them through momentary agitation, or to calm them before feeding on them. 

Cost: One Rouse Check and additional Willpower depending on circumstances. Dice Pool: Composure + Auspex 

System: The vampire rolls Composure + Auspex against Difficulty 2 and restores a number of superficial Willpower damage levels equal to the margin on the roll. Alternatively, the user restores one Aggravated Willpower damage level for every three successes in the margin. If successfully used on a mortal, Panacea similarly calms them if theyâ€™re in a turbulent emotional state, or puts them otherwise at ease. Use of this power takes a whole turn. If the vampire spends an entire scene instead, reduce the Difficulty to 0. Panacea must be used on someone other than the vampire invoking the power. A subject can be affected by the power only once per night. If the user soothes more than one subject per night, the user suffers superficial Willpower damage equal to half the number of successes in the margin for every additional subject, as they take on the burden of so many charges.
