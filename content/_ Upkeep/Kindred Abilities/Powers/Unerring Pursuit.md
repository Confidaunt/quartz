Locking eyes with a subject, the vampire coaxes forth a supernatural bond between themselves and the victim. For a number of nights, the user is able to view glimpses of the target and their environment whenever the target sees themselves on a reflective surface. The target is generally unaware of the being so observed, but witnesses the presence of their pursuer as someone standing just behind them in their own reflection. While not exclusive to the Sabbat, this power is frequently used to track quarry, whether vampires marked as prey or mortal witnesses requiring silencing. 

Amalgam: Dominate 1

Cost: One Rouse Check Dice Pool: Resolve + Auspex 

System: The user locks eyes with the target, if only for a split second, and rolls Resolve + Auspex. On a win, the effect lasts for one night, plus one for each success in the margin. (If used against a vampire, the Difficulty of the roll is 3.) While the power is active the user can concentrate for a turn to gain a view of the last position of the target from the perspective of the target’s own reflection. Essentially, they view a mental impression of the most recent moment the victim saw themselves, intentionally or unintentionally, in a mirror or mirror-like surface (including polished chrome, shopping windows, or even someone’s sunglasses). Note that Obfuscate provides no protection from this power, as it relies on the victim’s self-perception. The user can recognize the surroundings of the target with an Intelligence + Streetwise (for urban areas) or Intelligence + Survival (for rural areas), the Difficulty depending on circumstances, such as being indoors, but should range from 2 to 4. The target can get a glimpse of their pursuer in their own reflection on a Wits + Awareness test at Difficulty 4, and only on a critical win will recognize their face, or recall it from where the individual saw them if they don’t know them personally. 

Duration: One night plus one for each success (or in the margin, in the case of a vampire target)
