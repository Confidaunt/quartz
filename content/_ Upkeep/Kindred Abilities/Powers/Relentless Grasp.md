The vampireâ€™s grip becomes impossibly strong and once they get a good hold of something they are almost impossible to dislodge, short of dismemberment. 

Cost: One Rouse Check

System: The vampire adds their Potence rating as automatic successes to any attempt that involves holding on to something. This includes attempts to maintain a grapple, though the initial grapple test does not benefit from this bonus.
