Amalgam: Presence 1 

The vampire possesses the power to change the very personality or opinions of a subject, at least temporarily. While other powers enable them to puppeteer mindless victims, this power lets them alter the intents or passions of a victim instead. They can make someone desire a stranger, abandon their family, distrust their own beliefs, or simply want a beer. Vampires known to utilize this power indiscriminately often find themselves shunned by their peers, whether from disdain or utter fear. 

Cost: One Rouse Check 

System: No test is required against an unprepared mortal victim, but a prepared mortal or another vampire requires a test of Manipulation + Dominate against Composure + Resolve. Radical changes to core beliefs – making a vegan crave a steak or making a pacifist violent, for example – also merit an attempt to resist, even by unprepared mortals. The suggestion remains in effect for a scene, at which point the victim snaps out of it. 

Duration: One scene
