The vampire’s movement becomes a jittering blur, making it extremely difficult to land attacks on them even when they are not aware of the opponent or actively defending. 

Cost: One Rouse Check per turn 

System: Attacks that achieve fewer successes than the user’s Celerity rating always miss, no matter the result of a defense or dodge test (if any). This also works against surprise attacks or other attacks that disallow defense tests, such as Lightning Strike. Activating this power requires one Rouse Check and extending it requires an additional Check for each turn it is kept active. 

Duration: Until the user lets it lapse
