The eyes of the vampire turn into slitted, serpent-like orbs able to freeze a mortal meeting the vampire’s gaze in place. The user can even mesmerize other vampires with this power, though the effect is shortlived and likely to rouse the victim’s ire. 

Amalgam: Protean 1

Cost: Free 

Dice Pools: Charisma + Presence vs. Wits + Composure system: By catching the eye of a mortal (see avoiding eye contact on p. 255 in the Core book for victims actively trying to avoid it) the vampire can immobilize a victim, keeping them frozen in place as long as they themselves maintain eye contact. The effect can only be maintained on a single victim at a time, and ends if they suffer damage or are forcibly removed. Speech is still possible, though shouting is not. In order to paralyze a vampire in the same way, the user must win a contest of Charisma + Presence vs. Wits + Composure. The vampire victim can escape paralysis on any turn after the first by spending a point of Willpower. 

Duration: Until eye contact is broken or the scene ends.
