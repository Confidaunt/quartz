While many of the entropic effects of Oblivion are restricted to mortals, this Ceremony allows the wielder to infect the blood of a vessel, making an otherwise healthy-appearing mortal into pure poison to the children of Caine. Prerequisite: Necrotic Touch Ingredient: The vampire’s saliva 

Process: The vampire needs only introduce a drop of their spittle to the skin of their victim, either by feeding on them or by smearing it upon them through physical contact. 

System: A victim befouled in this way shows no symptoms, and is unaware of the harm done to them or the danger they pose to the undead. Anyone feeding on them will likewise be unaware of the effects apart from a rancid strangeness to their Blood. (Generous Storytellers can allow a Wits + Survival test at Difficulty 3 to notice that something is amiss, allowing the player to abort their feeding.) Once the feeding is done, the effect occurs: The feeding vampire gains Hunger instead of sating it, on a 1-for-1 basis. (A vampire who would’ve sated three Hunger would gain three Hunger.) This will likely risk hunger frenzy (see Vampire: The Masquerade p. 220). No matter if they are fed on or not, the infected mortal dies in their sleep the following night, the only clue to their fate a patch of – mildew? – and acrid night-sweat.
