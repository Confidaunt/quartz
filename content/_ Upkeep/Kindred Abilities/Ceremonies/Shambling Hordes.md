This Ceremony enables a necromancer to raise a group of aggressive, walking dead minions. 

Prerequisite Power: Aura of Decay 

Ingredients: A human corpse (or multiple human corpses), a fresh human sacrifice. 

Process: The vampire must have a separate corpse in addition to a human prepared for sacrifice. The vampire murders the sacrificial victim, spilling their blood on the corpse or corpses intended for animation. If the Ceremony is successful, the corpses stand (the recent sacrifice does not), revived with the fresh blood, and serve the vampire’s commands, even moderately complex orders such as “kill everyone who enters,” “groan if you see anyone pass this way,” or “terrorize that neighborhood.” Unlike the corpses raised using the Gift of False Life (see p. XX), these animated dead do not sit idle if left without commands, instead attacking anyone around them except for their master. 

System: The player makes their Ceremony roll, possibly incurring Stains in the process depending on the Chronicle Tenets and the Storyteller’s discretion. Due to the amount of blood spilled in this Ceremony, the caster must test to resist hunger frenzy (Difficulty 2). Upon a win a number of aggressive dead equal to the necromancer’s Oblivion rating or the number of prepared bodies (whichever is lower) receive the gift of animation. A critical win doubles their Oblivion rating for the purpose of determining corpses raised. Corpses animated this way do not decay and only enter repose if commanded to by the vampire, if the vampire meets final death, or if they are destroyed. As per the normal rules for temporary Advantages like these (see Vampire: The Masquerade p. 180), their continued usefulness beyond the current story must be ensured with Experience — such as through the Retainers Background (see Vampire: The Masquerade p. 196) — or the aggressive corpses may become unstable and unruly.
