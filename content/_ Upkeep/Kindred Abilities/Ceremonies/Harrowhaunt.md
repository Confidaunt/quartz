Some places seem haunted, raising the hackles of mortal and vampire alike. A place Harrowhaunted is in a different league. Places subjected to this Ceremony convey a sense of such miasmic dread that most breathing creatures find it hard to, well, breathe, let alone stay. Sabbat vampires often use this to discourage unwanted visitors from lingering in the proximity of their communal havens. While it won’t scare away encroaching vampires, most mortals will unconsciously take the long road around it, or make up excuses for why they’ll check up on the rumors surrounding the place “tomorrow... probably.” 

Prerequisite: Aura of Decay Ingredient: Mortals subjected to abject terror and suffering. The more the merrier. 

Process: It starts with a “party.” A number of mortals are confined to the place and inflicted with terror and torture that ends with their death. But this is no mercy. The broken remains of their souls, scarcely more than fear-urges and sublime revulsion, are bound to the place, their bones buried in the ground, and made to share their torment with anyone who enters uninvited. 

System: Mortals entering the vicinity (anything up to a two-story building) are beset by an irrational terror, requiring a Composure + Resolve test each turn to remain. If they fail they will indulge any excuse to leave, or run shrieking on a total failure. Vampires are less affected, but each scene spent in the location requires a test for fear frenzy.
