CeremonyId: 
Name: Traveler’s Call
Level: 1
Reference: Cults 93

This simple Ceremony is taught by the cult to all priests before their release into the wider world. Since all priests of Shalim are linked by their common bond with Apolleon the Traveler, they are able to use his presence in eternal Oblivion as a nexus between themselves and their followers. Pre-required Power: Oblivion’s Sight (see Chicago by Night) 

Ingredients: The black book gifted to them following their indoctrination into the cult 

Process: By using the Traveler’s Call with their black book in hand and the name of another Shalimite in mind, a priest can send a ripple out across Oblivion, calling the target to their location. Unlike a true summoning, this power does not place a compulsion upon the victim, but does alert the Shalimite being contacted to the vampire’s current location through a repetitive, flashing vision of the scenery surrounding the calling Kindred. 

System: The cultist must possess their black book and know the name of another Shalimite. The vampire’s player makes a Ceremony roll (Difficulty 3). The contacted vampire can choose to ignore the call, but the flashing vision gives them −2 dice to all rolls involving concentration for the remainder of the scene, at which point the call disappears. A critical win by the vampire allows them to send a single-word message to their point of contact along with the vision.
