This Ceremony allows a vampire to create a tear in the Shroud through which wraiths can pass and vampires with the correct Ceremonies can physically enter the Shadowlands. 

Prerequisite Power: Necrotic Plague 

Ingredients: A scalpel that’s been used to cut into someone living, chalk or charcoal, a silk sheet, a human sacrifice. 

Process: The vampire hangs a silk sheet over a wall in a place where the Shroud density (see p. XX) is standard, thin, or frayed. They then murder a human sacrifice against the sheet, usually via some manner of bloodletting, and as blood coats the sheet, cut it open with a scalpel. The Ceremony widens the portal between the world of the living — which wraiths call the Skinlands — and the Shadowlands. Wraiths who enter the Skinlands via this method take to haunting locations and people, indulging in their passions, and possess humans if their powers allow for it. Some treat the vampire with gratitude for splitting the Shroud, while others enjoy harassing the necromancer responsible. 

System: The caster kills the human sacrifice, which may result in Stains depending on the Chronicle Tenets and the Storyteller’s discretion. When cutting the silk sheet with a scalpel, their player makes the Ceremony roll (with −1 Difficulty if the scalpel was used in the human sacrifice). Due to the amount of blood spilled in this Ceremony, the caster must roll to resist falling into hunger frenzy (Difficulty 2). For every success on the Ceremony roll, the Shroud’s density reduces by a level, down to being absent. Following this Ceremony, vampires can access the Shadowlands with Ex Nihilo (see p. XX) more easily, but importantly, if the Shroud rating is reduced to absent, wraiths can spill into the Skinlands as they see fit for the remainder of the chapter. Once the chapter concludes, a Shroud density of absent increases to frayed and the gateway for wraiths closes.
