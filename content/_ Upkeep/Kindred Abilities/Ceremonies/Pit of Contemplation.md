Only the most powerful of Shalim’s priests have been able to manifest this ability, but the effect is one of the most terrifying and demonstrative uses of Oblivion yet seen in modern nights. The ability to c ast an enemy into Oblivion terrifies even the toughest of Kindred. Pre-required Power: Tenebrous Avatar (see Chicago by Night) 

Ingredients: Pot of ink, three pints/six liters or more of blood from an innocent the user murdered, an unlit room (this power does not work outside) 

Process: The vampire personally murders an innocent mortal, likely incurring Stains depending on the Chronicle Tenets and their Convictions. While innocence is subjective, traditional sacrifices are children, virgins, and holy individuals. The vampire then takes at least three pints/six liters of the deceased’s blood into an unlit room and uses it to paint a doorway on a wall in the chamber. Finally, the vampire splashes a pot of ink onto the blood-painted portal. Focusing their will upon the gateway, the priest opens a tear through to Oblivion. Anyone foolish or unfortunate enough to fall into the gap is immediately transported into a pocket of eternal black nothingness for as long as the priest se es fit. If the priest is destroyed without releasing their prisoners, any undead prisoners remain trapped in the void (unless and until another vampire reverses the Ceremony). Priests may choose to pass through the door, but doing so condemns them forever. Some Shalimites do this 94 chapter two: Kindred Religions when they feel they have completed their work as a part of the cult. 

System: Following the Ceremony steps, the priest’s player makes their Ceremony roll, and on a success the effect is quick and implosive. A hole opens at the point where ink and blood mix. The hole dr aws objects, air, and people toward it and, if they fail a Dexterity + Athletics roll (Difficulty 4), sucks them into a pock et within Oblivion. While trapped, victims are suspended in an endless blackness. They cannot see or hear anyone or anything around themselves. Only the priest who conjures this blasphemous gateway can free those held within, by pouring a vampire’s vitae over the painted door (sufficient to provoke a Rouse Check). Mortals sucked into Oblivion are instantly killed.
