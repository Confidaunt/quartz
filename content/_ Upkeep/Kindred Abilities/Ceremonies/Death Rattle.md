This Ceremony allows the caster to inflict the full sensory experience of a chosen wraith’s death upon a target. 

Prerequisite Power: Fatal Precognition 

Ingredients: A wraith’s fetter, a personal item owned by the intended target (living or undead, but not another wraith), the caster’s vitae, over proof rum, a black candle, a clay bowl large enough to hold the fetter and target’s personal belonging. 

Process: The caster must be in close pr oximity to the desired wraith in order to successfully complete the Ceremony, typically through the use of Summon Spirit. The fetter and target’s possession are combined in the bowl along with the c aster’s vitae. The candle is held over the bowl and lit allowing the w ax to drip into the contents of the bowl. The name of the wr aith and the target are chanted repeatedly. As the wax melts, it forms a seal between the items inside of the bowl, creating a bridge between the wraith and the desired target. When this seal is broken, the rum ignites the possession of the target and they experience the death of the wraith. 

System: The caster makes their Ceremony roll and the target contests with Composure + Resolve whether or not they know they’re being targeted. On a win by the caster the victim experiences a vision of the wraith’s death, with a higher margin leading to a more vivid experience. For example, one point of margin is enough for the target to have brief flashes of the moment, while five may cause the target’s experience to be so vivid that they will be shocked to realize they’re not dead afterwards. If the wraith died a violent death, this causes Superficial Willpower damage equal to the margin of the roll, but even a peaceful death inflicts one point as they experience the wraith’s dying gasp. A critical win from the target rebounds this trauma back onto the necromancer, inflicting the margin as Superficial Willpower damage to them instead. Be it a personal curiosity in death, to investigate the situation of a death first hand, or an attempt to gain a deep understanding of a particular wraith, the caster may wish to be the target of the Ceremony. They roll only against the normal Ceremony Difficulty, and the caster must open their mind to accept any resulting Willpower damage.
