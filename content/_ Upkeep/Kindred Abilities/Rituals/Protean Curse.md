RitualId: 
Name: Protean Curse
Level: 4
Reference: Folio 173
---
This ritual transforms the target into a bat similar to the level four Protean ability. Metamorphosis.   
Ingredients: A vial of rabid vampire bat blood, Kindred vitae.   

Process: The target must drink a vial of blood from a rabid vampire bat, mixed with Kindred vitae.   

System: The caster makes a Rouse Check and mixes one Hunger worth of their blood with the blood of a rabid vampire bat and gives it to the target to drink. The ritual is cast, and upon a successful ritual roll vs. the target’s Stamina + Occult roll, the target is transformed into a bat per the Metamorphosis ability of the Protean Discipline. The target may elect to resist this transformation. If the target rolls more successes than the ritual’s practitioner, they prevent the transformation, while their Dramatic Failure can leave them in a horrifically deformed, half-human, half-bat state. The ritual can be cast on both Kindred and humans and lasts for a full evening or until the caster dispels the ritual via a successful ritual test. The duration of Protean Curse can be extended by making a Rouse Check and a successful ritual roll at the beginning of each night the caster wants to maintain the ritual. A Critical Win for the practitioner doubles the duration of Protean Curse.
