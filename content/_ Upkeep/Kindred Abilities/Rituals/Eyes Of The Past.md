This ritual shows what happened in the casterâ€™s present location at a specific time in the past up to five years ago.  

Ingredients: One drop of blood for each year the caster is trying to look backward in time (three or more drops requires a Rouse Check).  

Process: The caster selects the location for their ritual, cuts their hand, and allows the drops of blood to spill on the earth.  

System: A successful Ritual test allows the caster to see what happened in their present location at a specific time of their selection, up to five years ago. The caster can see what happened in the past as if they had been standing where they are now. Duration is one scene with clarity of vision determined by the number of successes scored. The vampire cannot recall the vision with any clarity after the scene elapses, meaning the Storyteller is not obligated to answer any questions about the vision after that time. A Critical Win permanently fixes the scene in their memory.
