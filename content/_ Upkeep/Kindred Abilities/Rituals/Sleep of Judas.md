RitualId: 
Name: Sleep of Judas
Level: 3
Reference: Streets 77
---
Ingredients: Blood of Willerton’s Judas tree (though possibly the blood from another mystical landmark), opium.   

Process: The sorcerer distills and boils the blood of the Judas Tree until only a black tar-like substance remains. They mix this with an equal amount of opium, which can either be used as a paste or re-liquefied with no loss of effect.   

System: The sorcerer makes the Ritual roll when the target is drugged. On a normal success, the victim may oppose by rolling dice equal to their remaining undamaged Health boxes. A critical success immediately incapacitates a vampire and kills a mortal or ghoul. Sleep of Judas wears off after a number of hours equal to the sorcerer’s Intelligence.
