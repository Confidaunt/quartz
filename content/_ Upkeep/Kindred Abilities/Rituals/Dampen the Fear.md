This Ritual allows the caster to briefly douse their natural vampiric fear of fire.   

Ingredients: A holy object, such as a crucifix, bible, or Qur’an.   

Process: The vampire must burn the holy symbol before walking into, past, or otherwise interacting with fire. The object does not need to be destroyed, just exposed to the fire.   

System: A successful Ritual roll following the burning of the holy object grants the character +2 dice on all rolls relating to resisting Rötschreck. A critical win results in the character needing to make no terror frenzy rolls
