By ingesting the tongue and an eye of a person the caster gains the ability to read and speak any language known by the victim.     

Ingredients: A fresh eye and tongue of a person     

Process: Plucking the ingredients fresh from the victim, the vampire chews and swallows them. (This most likely incurs a Stain.)     

System: The Rouse Check required for this ritual allows for the supernatural dissolution of the ingredients once swallowed. Once this is done, make the Ritual roll. A win gives the caster the ability to read and speak any language known by the victim, at the same skill level for a week. A critical win extends the duration to a month.
