A painful ritual to perform, this allows the caster to make themselves and even their comrades resistant to fire.     

Ingredients: A fingertip of the caster.     

Process: The vampire cuts one of their fingertips off and burns it together with their Blood in a golden chalice or bowl.     

System: Make a Stamina + Resolve test (Difficulty 3) to cut off a fingertip. On a winning Ritual roll, a bluish flame consumes the Blood and fingertip, signaling the completion of the ritual. For the rest of the night fire damage to the caster is halved. This ritual can be performed on others, but the fingertips sacrificed must all belong to the caster. The mutilation is not enough to count as damage to the caster; the fingertip regrows during day-sleep.
