Level: 3
Reference: Folio 174

This ritual shrouds the caster in the illusion of a nondescript person that blends easily into crowds.   
Ingredients: A plain white mask.   

Process: The caster performs an hour-long ritual that concludes when they don a featureless white mask. A sweat of blood forms under the mask, spreading across the casterâ€™s body until they are coated in a ruby crust that mystically conceals their true identity. The mask itself slowly turns crimson until the ritual wears off.   

System: A successful Ritual test is required to activate this ritual. Upon success, the caster is cloaked in the illusion that they are an ordinary person in their mid-20s, with a nondescript face and average body similar to the Obfuscate ability Mask of a Thousand Faces. Illusion of Perfection can be pierced by the Auspex ability Sense the Unseen, with a contested Wits + Auspex vs. the successes scored on the ritual roll. Illusion of Perfection lasts one scene, but a Critical Win extends its duration to an entire evening.
