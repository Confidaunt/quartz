Performed before dawn, this ritual allows the caster to awake at any sign of danger, fully alert as if awake during the night.     

Ingredients: The burnt bones and feathers of a rooster.     

Process: The caster mixes the ashes with their own Blood, drawing a circle with the mixture around their place of sleep.     

System: Do not make a Ritual roll unless true danger appears. If the caster is threatened during the day, make the Ritual roll then, with the caster rousing on a win. For the duration of the scene the vampire ignores the daytime penalties for staying awake. On a critical win, the effects last until the following dawn.
