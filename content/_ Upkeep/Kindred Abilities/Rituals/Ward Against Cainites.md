RitualId: 
Name: Ward Against Cainites
Level: 4
Reference: V5 280
---
This Ritual wards an item against all vampires except the caster. Any attempt by them to touch the item triggers the effect. However, a vampire examining the Ward with Auspex can read the name of the caster in it with a successful contest of Intelligence + Auspex vs. the casterâ€™s Intelligence + Blood Sorcery. This ward uses the standard rules for Wards (p. 275).     

Ingredients: Ash warm from a still-burning fire; casters risk terror frenzy, and cannot inscribe this Ward that night if they succumb to it.
