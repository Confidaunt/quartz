Normally tattoos, scars, and other changes to vampire flesh fade during the day’s sleep. Yet some Kindred seek to make a mark on their own flesh, and give that mark permanence. 

Ingredients: Molten silver poured over a tattoo, brand, or other body modification. 

Process: The vampire casting the ritual pours the molten silver over the target’s tattoo, brand, or body modification. The target suffers damage from the molten silver, but once mended, the affected modification remains permanent. 

System: A successful Ritual yields a permanent body modification for the target. This modification cannot be removed by any other means and is now considered part of the target’s undying body. Pouring the molten silver onto the body modification inflicts one point of Superficial damage, which may be mended as normal.
