The culmination of Hutter’s study of the Blood, this Ritual is deceptively easy to learn and to cast, but far-reaching in its effects.   

Ingredients: An unconscious human, a flawless crystal chalice.  

Process: The caster chants scripture over the human target for three hours. Over the course of the ritual, the human gradually weakens, while the chalice fills with a clear, sweet-smelling liquid.   

System: A successful Ritual fills the chalice to the brim at the end of three hours and kills the human victim. The clear liquid produced functions exactly like fresh blood from the human victim for the next hour, carrying any Resonance and Dyscrasia the victim exhibited. Since the victim must be unconscious during the ritual, anything but a Phlegmatic resonance is difficult to obtain. If a vampire drinks nothing but the liquid produced by this ritual for a period of one month, her Vitae turns completely clear. Though it mostly functions as normal, this clear Blood has an unusual effect on Kindred who consume it: until the next sunset, they are vulnerable to diablerie. A would-be diablerist gains three dice to her Strength + Resolve roll against the victim, and she may use the experience points she gains to increase her Blood Potency by at least one point, regardless of her victim’s power. She also does not gain the black veins in her aura that usually accompany the act. Hutter keeps these properties of clear vitae a secret even from his truest believers.
