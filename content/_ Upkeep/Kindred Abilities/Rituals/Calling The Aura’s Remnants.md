This ritual allows the caster to speak with the residual psychic aura of someone who has died.  

Ingredients: A human corpse or the corpse of a destroyed vampire.  

Process: The ritual must be cast within ten feet of a human corpse or the corpse of a destroyed vampire.  

System: A successful Ritual test allows the caster to speak with the animate reflection of the deceased for one scene as if they were still alive. This communication is not with the deceased spirit and only has access to the memories of the deceased up to the time of death. A Critical Win extends the duration of the speech to an entire evening.
