By imbibing the Blood of a willing Kindred, a vampire can relive the memories of the donor, who guides them through the donor’s past experiences. This can allow the vampire to “recall” memories from before they were born! In addition, these guided journeys can unlock Discipline powers, Merits, and potentially other gifts of the donor’s Blood. 

Ingredients: The vitae of another vampire, dried rosemary, and fresh poppies or forget-me-nots. 

Process: The sorcerer burns the flowers and rosemary, blending the ashes with the donated vitae, then drinks the Blood. 

System: The sorcerer selects a Memoriam goal (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 312), or one of the goals below: A Level 1 Discipline power; a one-dot Merit •A Level 2 Discipline power; a two-dot Merit ••A Level 3 Discipline power; a three-dot Merit The power may be encountered during the Memoriam, or the memory itself deals with the donor learning the power. The Merit may emerge from a similar circumstance, or result from the character unlocking some secret or potential in the past. While the player may pursue a specific power or Merit, the Storyteller is the final judge of which gift they gain. All gifts of guided Memoriam fade as new native memories overlay these resurfaced and imported ones. They last until the end of the session, or (if the guided Memoriam happened at the end of the session) until the end of the next one. Powers This power is independent of the sorcerer’s other powers and does not count against the limit of powers they can possess in a single Discipline, although they still need to fulfill the Discipline rating requirement. This power cannot be used as a requirement to learn another power, but a character could gain an Amalgam power temporarily if they already knew the other prerequisite power. Merits Merit dots cannot be spread among different Merits or added to existing Merits the player character may already have. Entering the Guided Memoriam A guided Memoriam follows all of the same rules as a standard Memoriam except the Kindred donating the Blood and memories rolls the required Rouse check. The donor remains present throughout the scene as a spiritual or disembodied presence or guide that only the Kindred experiencing the Memoriam can interact with. Everyone experiencing the guided Memoriam must partake of the offered Blood. Walking through another Kindred’s memories is a particularly unnatural experience and inflicts penalties based on how far back in time the journey delves. The Blood offered by the Kindred donor is always considered a deep drink (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 312) and the bonuses supplied from that usually offset some of these penalties.
