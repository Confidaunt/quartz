GENTLE MIND This ritual fortifies the target’s mind against frenzy.   

Ingredients: Crystal glass, Kindred vitae.   

Process: The caster shares blood with the target of the ritual while the caster whispers quietly into the target’s ear, weaving a temporary cage around the target’s beast.   

System: The caster must share a glass of blood with their target. A successful Ritual test grants the target a four-die bonus to resist frenzy for one scene. A Critical Win extends this duration to an evening. The caster must share blood with another and cannot cast this ritual upon themselves.
