The Ritual of Transferring the Soul is a 5th level combined Blood Sorcery ritual and Oblivion ceremony that requires two Kindred participants: one who knows the requisite level of Blood Sorcery, and another who is versed in Oblivion. It is possible for a single Kindred who possesses both Disciplines to perform the ritual alone.

Performing the ritual requires a Rouse check, and successes in both an Intelligence + Blood Sorcery test (Difficulty 6) and an Intelligence + Oblivion test (Difficulty 6). Once the ritual has been performed successfully to imbue the selected objects with the subject’s essence, combining the objects again to restore the subject’s power requires the subject to come into contact with them again.

Multiple objects must be used – at least five – as no single object is capable of storing all of a vampire’s essence. Theoretically however any number of objects could be used in this process, with the power conveyed by each object relative to the total number of objects used. The power restored to the subject is similarly proportional to the number of objects combined in the ritual’s final phase. Importantly, this combination can only be performed once, so any missing objects become inert, and the remaining essence contained within
them is forever lost.

It is also possible to break the link between the objects and the subject by performing another instance of the ritual while in possession of the objects, but before the subject can complete the final incantation. A successful casting releases the essence within each object present, rendering them useless.
