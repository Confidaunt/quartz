ILLUSION OF PEACEFUL DEATH This ritual heals obvious wounds on a corpse, causing a body to appear as though it died a natural death.   

Ingredients: A white feather.   

Process: The caster must symbolically “dust” the body with a white feather.   

System: A successful Ritual test causes a corpse to appear as if it died a natural death. This ritual does not add blood to the corpse, but does reduce the chance that this blood loss will be discovered (increase difficulty of all rolls to determine cause of death by three). The body must have at least half its original blood for this ritual to succeed. A Critical Win increases the difficulty of all rolls to determine cause of death by five.
