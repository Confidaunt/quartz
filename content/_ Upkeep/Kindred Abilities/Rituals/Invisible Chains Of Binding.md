The blood sorcerer binds a subject in invisible chains, confining them to a single spot for the duration of the Ritual. 

Ingredients: A link of chain. 

Process: The sorcerer inscribes the sigils on the chain using their own Blood. The process takes an hour, at which point the chain link can be concealed on their person to be used on a target at a later time, at which point the chain is thrown at their feet. 

System: When throwing the prepared link at a target the user makes a Ritual roll against the target’s Strength + Resolve. The target is unable to move from the spot for one hour per success in the margin as long as the chain link remains intact and within three yards / meters of them. A bound target suffers a four-dice penalty to any physical defense tests as well as to brawl and melee actions. The chain link corrodes to dust at the end of the Ritual’s effect.
