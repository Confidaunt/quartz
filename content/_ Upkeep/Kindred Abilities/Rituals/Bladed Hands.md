This ritual sharpens the caster’s hands to a razor’s edge.  

Ingredients: A pair of razor blades, two drops of Kindred vitae.  

Process: The caster places a razor blade in each palm, gripping them tightly as the ritual is cast. At the end of the ritual, they vanish into the caster’s person, leaving a pair of supernaturally sharp hands in their wake.  

System: The caster must make a successful Ritual test and two Rouse Checks. Success grants the caster +2 damage on all Brawl attacks made with the caster’s hands. The caster must be very careful about what they touch while employing Bladed Hands (+1 difficulty to all rolls to handle delicate objects). A Critical Win increases the damage to +3. The ritual lasts for a single evening.
