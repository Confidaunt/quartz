RitualId: 
Name: Communicate With Kindred Sire
Level: 2
Reference: V5 277
---
The caster uses the bond between sire and childe to open a bridge between minds, allowing the childe to create a telepathic link for the purpose of long-distance communication. As with some other Rituals, this one sees a resurgence in these nights of wiretaps and electronic surveillance.     

Ingredients: An object previously possessed by the sire and a silver bowl filled with clear water.     

Process: The caster submerges the object in water and lets their Blood drip into the bowl, concentrating upon the last memory of their sire for up to 30 minutes.     

System: Make the ritual roll after 15 minutes have passed. A win allows for ten minutes of twoway silent mental communication once 15 more minutes have passed. A critical win allows immediate communication. Any major disturbance on either end breaks the connection.
