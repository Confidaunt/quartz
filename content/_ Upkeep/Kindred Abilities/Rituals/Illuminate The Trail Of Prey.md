illuminate the trail of prey The ritual allows the caster to perceive the previous whereabouts of a designated person as a subtly glowing trail, visible only to them.     

Ingredients: A white satin ribbon.     

Process: The performer of the ritual soaks the ribbon in their own Blood, setting it alight.     

System: If the Ritual roll is a win the ribbon catches fire despite being wet, burning fiercely like a fuse. Once consumed, the ritual takes effect. While the ritual remains active, the caster can follow faint traces of the target even in areas where they left no tracks, such as crowded cities. To follow the tracks, the caster makes an Intelligence + Survival roll against a Difficulty equal to 6 minus the margin on the ritual test. The target must be known by face by the caster, who sees the path travelled by the victim over the previous 24 hours. The path remains visible for the entire night; a critical win extends this to two nights.
