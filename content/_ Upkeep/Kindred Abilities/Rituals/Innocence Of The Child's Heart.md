RitualId: 
Name: Innocence Of The Child's Heart
Level: 4
Reference: Folio 172

Developed by Nicolai himself, this ritual allows the caster to conceal their Kindred aura from users of Auspex.   

Ingredients: A toy belonging to a mortal child.   

Process: The caster must acquire the toy of an innocent mortal child and use the ritual to mystically infuse it with the power of their Kindred vitae, drawing the child’s innocence into their aura. The caster must then carry the toy on their person to mask themselves from the powers of Auspex.   

System: The caster makes a Rouse Check and makes their Ritual test. Upon success, the caster’s aura is altered to a brilliant white, untainted by vampirism. Auspex users employing Scry the Soul on the caster will perceive their aura as white until the effects of the ritual dissipate, unless they make a contested roll between their Intelligence + Auspex versus the caster’s Intelligence + Blood Sorcery + four dice. The ritual lasts one night unless the ritual test is made at +2 to difficulty which extends it to a year and a day. A Critical Win doubles the ritual’s duration. Note that there is no recorded instance of Nicolai sharing this ritual with his fellow Tremere and can only be learned by capturing Nicolai’s notes or via other method of the Storyteller’s determination.
