Web of Hunger is an extension of the Extinguish Vitae ritual (see Vampire p. 273). Instead of controlling a single person’s vitae, de Worde cast the effect over his entire underworld empire, slowly and corrosively draining vitae from its occupants. The ritual is only possible through possession of Mithras’ dagger, as de Worde drains some of its powers to fuel the ritual. Without the dagger to maintain it, Web of Hunger would likely be a 4th or 5th level ritual. The power of the vitae drained is transferred to de Worde, who uses it to resist the terrible pull of the Beckoning.
