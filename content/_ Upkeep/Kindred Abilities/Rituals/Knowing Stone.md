This Ceremony enables Necromancers to identify the locations and existences of specific ghosts. They need a stone from a church wall (or other holy site) and a cup of the caster’s vitae.They pour it from their body into a vessel and then uses it to write out the true name of a deceased human on the consecrated stone. If the individual still exists as a ghost, their location becomes clear to the vampire.

System: Roll Resolve + Oblivion (Difficulty 2). If the target exists as a ghost, the vampire receives a vision of the ghost’s location. The vision can be accessed for the remainder of the scene.
