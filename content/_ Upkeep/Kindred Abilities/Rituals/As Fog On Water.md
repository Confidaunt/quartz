With this Ritual the vampire is able to traverse any body of water, silently walking upon it as if they were weightless, fog rising from their footsteps. 

Ingredients: A piece of wood from a ship, and water 

Process: The vampire submerges a piece of wood in the body of water they want to cross while spilling their Blood into it. 

System: Upon a successful Ritual roll the vampire can walk across the surface of the water for the rest of the night. They can end this effect any time they wish but cannot walk on the surface again until they recast the Ritual.
