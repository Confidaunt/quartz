This ritual forces Lupines into their wolf form.   

Ingredients: Wolf blood, Kindred vitae, a silver jug.   

Process: The caster mixes Kindred vitae with wolf’s blood and pours the mixture from a silver jug around a specific area. This can be as small as a meter or large enough to encircle a house.   

System: The caster makes three Rouse checks to summon the blood necessary for the ritual and marks out a closed area with a mixture of Kindred vitae and wolf’s blood. A successful Ritual test forces all Lupines crossing the threshold defined by the caster to automatically transform into their Lupus form, unless they succeed on a contested Willpower test against the casters Intelligence + Blood Sorcery or the number of successes scored on the initial ritual roll (if year-long). The ritual dissipates at dawn unless the initial ritual roll is made at +2 to difficulty. If successful, the ritual lasts a year and a day. A Critical Win doubles the number of successes the Lupine needs on its roll to defeat the ritual. The Unseen Change forces the target Lupine into their form as a normal wolf, denying them the raw power of their dreaded half-wolf form.
