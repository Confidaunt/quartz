RitualId: 
Name: Warding Circle Against Spirits
Level: 3
Reference: V5 279
---
This Ritual creates a circular Ward on the floor or ground, intended to prevent the passage of spirits. Although more difficult than some Warding circles, it is one of the most commonly found in grimoires and other sources. A human occultist could potentially reconstruct a functioning version of this Ritual with an Intelligence + Occult test (Difficulty 6), although they could not cast it without vitae or some other supernatural aid or element. This ward uses the standard rules for Warding circles (p. 275).     

Ingredients: The caster draws the Warding circle with an iron knife dipped in salt and Blood.
