The caster of this Ritual diverts hungry flame from their flesh, using an enchanted coating of vitae like a buffer and can set items and people alight using the fire. This Ritual is a phenomenal breach of the Masquerade as the power is entirely visible and can cause intense environmental feedback, not to mention the bloody coating of the caster’s hands before activation.  

Ingredients: Sufficient vitae (from any vampire) to coat the caster’s arms up to the elbows, a source of flame (such as a lighter).  

Process: The vampire immerses their arms in the blood and withstands the urge to feed or frenzy. After extracting their arms, exposure to flame will ignite the vitae rather than the vampire it coats. The vampire can then go on to set targets alight using the fire on their skin.  

System: If the user is at Hunger 4 or more, make a hunger frenzy test at Difficulty 3 to avoid draining the ingredients. At any point during the night they may expose the vitae to fire and make a Ritual roll. A win ignites flames on the vampire’s hands and arms, which in a spectacular display provoke a terror frenzy test (Difficulty 2) in all nearby vampires except the caster. They may touch others with Dexterity + Brawl in physical combat to inflict two Aggravated Health damage. Entering a grapple ignites the other person’s clothes, continuing the damage each turn until a Composure + Survival roll (Difficulty 3) is won to end the burn. The caster is only resistant to flame on their arms, and will burn as usual elsewhere. The fiery arms extinguish when the caster wills it or when the scene ends.
