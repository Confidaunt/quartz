A unique flavor is a treat to be shared, and the busy members of the Penny Dining Club seldom have time to do so slowly and safely. This ritual allows multiple Kindred to partake in a Dyscrasia, without destroying it or having to wait for it to “recharge.” Generally, the Thaumaturge will perform Enrich the Blood on their target first, to stretch their choice dish further.  

Ingredients: An object of significance to the target, appropriate to the Resonance of their Dyscrasia.  

Process: The caster must taste the target’s blood, then hold the object and concentrate upon its Resonance for several minutes. The object must then be returned to the target.  

System: A successful Ritual roll increases the potency and utility of the target’s Dyscrasia, providing its effects to anyone who slakes at least 1 point of Hunger from the target. This effect dissipates after three nights.
