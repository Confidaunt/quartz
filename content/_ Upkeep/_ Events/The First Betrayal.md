[[Ilya Meyers]] was a trusted Tremere. The [[Bleeding Hearts]] were one of the few coteries that remained untarnished in the wake of Vienna's Fall. It makes sense that the coterie was called on to guard the Vaults. On the second night that they were called, Ilya makes her move. She kills her coterie quickly and uses their blood to crack the vault open. She's interrupted by the Keeper of Elysium, [[Candon Nalband]] who sensed the incursion from Elysium a block away. 

She's able to both collect a number of tomes that were previously forbidden to her and use Candon's blood to trigger the seeking ritual on all blood present in Elysium. This makes the tracking of anyone outside of those willing to once again produce their blood able to be tracked. 

She uses three [[Submerged Directive]]s on her coterie members. On [[Ruby George]] it's "Defend me from bodily and mental harm by [[Phyllis Savage]]". On [[Phyllis Savage]] it's "Defend me from bodily and mental harm by [[Jeremiah Giles]]." On [[Jeremiah Giles]] it's "Defend me from bodily and mental harm by [[Ruby George]]."

She puts a [[Herd Ward]]over the mortals they were supposed to be feeding on that night and disguised it with an [[Enrich the Blood]] ritual. Right in front of the vault and with a little bit of [[Soporific Touch]], she's able to have them fight each other and her triggering the directive and neatly taking care of the amount of power that she's going to need to crack open the vault. 

Unfortunately in this time, [[Candon Nalband]] finds her and she is forced to use her [[Ward Against Cainites]] whip and [[Creatio Ignis]] to put him down. She also uses her knowledge of Blood Sorcery to bend the wards into harming [[Candon Nalband]] enough to pop his head off with her whip.
