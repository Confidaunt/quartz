[[Marrok Fabron]] calls on those he can trust and makes a speedy plan to depose Prince [[Osmont Lamirand]] before the first hour of night passes on the next day. It's clear that Osmont is broken in a way that is beyond hope and action must be taken. The breech of the vault is final straw.

Osmont Lamirand is to be staked and kept safely within the vaults until such time as stability is once again restored to the Twin Cities. In his place, Marrok Fabron will rule.

The members of the Conspiracy are: [[Aldric Fiddlehare]], [[Lai Da]], and [[Yustina Nikolaeva]]. Maybe more?
