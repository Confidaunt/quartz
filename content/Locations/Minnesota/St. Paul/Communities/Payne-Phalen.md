District 5 - Payne-Phalen

The Payne-Phalen city district includes the Railroad Island, Phalen Park, Rivoli Bluff, Vento, Wheelock Park, and Williams Hill neighborhoods, and ranges from a blue-collar area to the south to a middle-class area north of Maryland Avenue, including upscale real estate around Lake Phalen. The neighborhood was originally a 160-acre tract jointly purchased by William Sprigg Hall, Harwood Iglehart, and Charles Mackubin, Southern slaveowners who named the neighborhood's streets after the flowers of their homeland, including Hawthorn, Hyacinth, and Magnolia.
