District 17 - Downtown

Downtown Saint Paul is home to Xcel Energy Center (home of the Minnesota Wild), Cray Plaza across from Mears Park, and Wells Fargo Place. Downtown hosts several parks, most notably Rice Park, one of the oldest parks in the country. The street life has been improving in some areas of downtown, including Mears Park bars and restaurants and along Wabasha and St. Peter Streets, where a small collection of restaurants has developed. The extensive skyway system connecting most of the office buildings has contributed to the removal of foot traffic from the streets.
