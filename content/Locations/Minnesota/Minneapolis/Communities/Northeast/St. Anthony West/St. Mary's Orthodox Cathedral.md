Description:
St. Mary\'s Orthodox Cathedral began in 1887 as an eastern-rite Catholic community founded by Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants, most of whom came from the villages of Becherov, Komlosa, Stebnik, Regetovka in an area north of Presov in eastern Slovakia (then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). The community was officially received into the Orthodox Church on the feast of the Annunciation in 1891.
