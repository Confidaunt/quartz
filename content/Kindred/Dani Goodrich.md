Dani grew up in a bad neighborhood. She know how to have a good time and bounced from job to job. All of her money was poured into having amazing nights until that night four years back. She wasn't even sure who her sire was, but the Camarilla found her after she killed for the fifth time. No one had explained anything to her and she had been medicating with a good number of substances. The only thing that saved her was that she could walk in the daylight. Dani was overpowered by Kindred and fed some fucking delicious blood for three days and then found her true love Freddy. He was just amazing until he wasn't. 

[[Jack Marsh]] ate him up. That suits Dani just fine because Freddy isn't her type. [[Levi Serrano]] wasn't either, but he was on hand and they didn't have a history.

[[Jack Marsh]] is the new newbie. He's not that bad, does what he's told and doesn't cause too much trouble.

Dani likes, well until really recently it didn't matter what Dani likes. She bowed, she scraped, sat sat, she came when called, she ate what she was given. Then she slipped her leash, they all did. 

There should have been precautions against it. Dani's sure there were, but they were all neatly taken out by her loss of love for Freddy the fuckwad. Dani knows she's lucky. This sort of thing wouldn't happen again and she was going to live free and hurt the Camarilla as much as she could. 

She didn't realize quite how much heat could be brough down on her and her coterie. Diablerizing was apparently some big fucking crime, well fuck that. What they did to her was a crime, to all of them. Fighting the Sabbat, who just threw bodies into well defended positions, taught her some. Dani is ready to learn how to fuck the Camarilla.
