The world made sense to Leonardo Dupont. There are leaders and followers. Those above him are the leaders to all below, therefore he's a leader to all those in positions lower than his own. What doesn't make sense are the other clans. They are incredibly disordered and imperfect. 

Leonardo Dupont is a Kindred full of hatred for the weakness that he sees in others. He hates the fascinations of Evangeline Carter with the parade of mortal men that pass through her bedrooms. He hates the base nature of Enzo Farr that crosses well past the borders between man and animal. 

His own coterie is no exception. Marrok explained to him that he needed to bring those entrusted to him into line, but there was no hope of that. Thank the Thirteen that he'd managed to rid himself of two useless members in attacks by the Sabbat. It only took a minimal amount of manipulation to ensure their deaths and that it couldn't be linked back to him.

Now with the attacks by the Sabbat quiet for over a year, there's little hope of the members of his coterie meeting a bloody end on any sort of acceptable timeline. 

The world broke. Order was lost and that was entirely unacceptable. There were no answers forthcoming and he was snubbed at the Childes Ball. The Gangrel and Toreador were fucking again, after being restricted to necessary outings only. He could not stand it.

It wasn't hard to entrap the two and compel them to consume one another. It also wouldn't be hard to explain their deaths as a bloodbond gone wrong. Their relationship was well known. Honestly, he should have done it years ago. A few quick rituals and a few quick words, and he could wash his hands of their foolishness. 

Feigning ignorance of the outcome was easy as he didn't see what had occurred. He left before whatever happened resolved. He had no part in any deaths.
