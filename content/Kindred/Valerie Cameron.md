Valerie is tired. There's a lot of sexism in the Tremere. She's been doing her best to get by and she just can't. There's no managing up in the pyramid and shit always does it's best to flow downwards. 

So instead of struggling further, she cashed in all her goodwill and hard work to create a childe. A male childe that she could offload all of her work onto. It took time to find the right piece of shit. He had to be just right, just the kind of man that she hated, who would be forced to do exactly what she told him to do. 

The past twenty years has been great. She's offloaded everything and has been enjoying the life of 'management.' She should really get another one.
