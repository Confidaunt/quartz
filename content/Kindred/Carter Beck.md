Carter Beck is a dizzyingly boring person.  Unfortunately for them, their anonymity isn't enough to save them from being eaten by the Stargazers.

Carter doesn't want to die like so many other kindred. They've done their best to ensure that they doesn't meet such an untidy end. Being a kindred isn't just all blood orgies into the unending night. There's a great deal of upkeep that goes into keeping the oldest and longest conspiracy running. If they're in that thick of that, so integral to making sure that the nights are quiet, well, they'd be hard to replace.

Carter doesn't get into fights. There's no lover's quarrels. No blood feuds. They're happy in their coterie. Unfortunately it's this efficiency that get's him noticed by the Stargazers. They were so uninteresting it was rare to even remember their gender. That or they were just very good at making themselves be forgotten. They were also the point of contact for any paperwork that needed to be filled out by mortals for a building permit, or an NDA. The Stargazers knew that killing them would make it all that much harder to track them. 

In the end, they was killed for being too good at his job.
