Harrison Baker knows his place in the world. He's the childe of a fortunate and successful bloodline. He's in a Tremere run city. He's the only one of his bloodline in the city, so he has more authority that he might otherwise. He's also listless and without purpose. 

He doesn't practice blood sorcery with any sort of talent aside from the most basic. He abuses what little power he does have in the city. Kajus is both happy to indulge him and use the powers that his bloodline brings. 

Harrison doesn't pay much mind to either Roshan or Sadie, the first because she's too confident and the second because she stares with those enormous creepy eyes. Having the coterie haven to him and Kajus is certainly preferred. 

Harrison dies to a fire started by his abused ghouls.
