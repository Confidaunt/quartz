Verity Jiang is an all nonsense type of Brujah. She likes to cause problems for others. Seeing a kindred fight is the highlight of her night. She takes part in them often, but only when she's sure she's not actually in any danger. She's not a coward as such, but she doesn't have an active death wish. 

The world is a fucking mess. There isn't anything worth living for that really means anything. The only reason she's even in the city is because she's good at fighting Sabbat. She's not going to be here much longer and fuck it! If there's a good time to be had, she's going to grab it with both hands and drain it dry.

Verity isn't suicidal, she's also not risk adverse. 

Unfortunately for poor Andrew Edwards, her previous coterie member, she gave him the impression that the coterie was going to challenge Marrok Fabron for rule. Verity doesn't give a shit that he's dead now. It was a good show at least. Marrok, though very much a pretty little Tremere, had plenty enough fight in him to make it a good night for Verity.

She's going to ride this bitch down to the end and find somewhere else to call home.
