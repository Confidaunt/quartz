Vito is a relatively young kindred for her generation. This is mostly due to the depressive affect of her disgraced bloodline. That bloodline has also prevented her from leaving the Twin Cities. 

Sadie is a difficult person to get along with. Vito wants to go out into the world and see. It wouldn't be to hard to just go wandering and explore. You just don't need to tell anyone where you're coming from and stick to the outskirts. And avoid a few cities run by specific clans. Technically, Vito can leave at any time, but in truth, Sadie has withheld her blessing and without it, Vito isn't willing to leave. 

Vito isn't willing to take the lack of independence laying down. She made her way into a decent coterie without help. She earned a nice degree in economics, and now she's even a teacher! Vito has students. It's pretty clear that she's competent enough to be on her own. Sadie is just being over protective. How else do you explain such a good mask? A gregarious economist who has to hide her face behind an excuse of autism. She publishes prolifically and uses a ghoul on occasion to keep up appearances. 

Vito even found a cool conspiracy and joined it! Tzimisce have a reputation, but so do Nosferatu. Elijah seems like a very nice Kindred, everyone in her coterie say so. Elijah even said he'd be willing to try to shape her disfigurement so she could claim a different bloodline.
