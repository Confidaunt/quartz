Ruby George knows that his great great great something grandsire fucked up. He doesn't care. Why should some old fuck determine what his worth is? Great Grandpa Vox cares way to much about old dumb shit. Ruby's gramps, never met the guy, but he fucked off out of the Tremere Cities and no one's heard from him since. Vox claims he was killed by Greatfuckwhatever's enemies, but seriously? Ruby would run too if he could get out of here quick enough. 

Ruby did manage to piss Vox off enough to get himself kicked out of the Labyrinth and recognized as his own person after Mom-sire got wacked by Sabbat fucks. 

Ilya's cool. She listens to him. She understands him and even promised to help him leave the city. She said that he needs to prove himself a good young neonate and she's write letters of recommendation for him. How fucking old school is that? She said she was writing to someone out in France. Dude, France Fucks!

It's shitty that so many Tremere assholes went crazy when the bloodbonds broke, but Ilya's still got his back!
