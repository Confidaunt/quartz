Guinea, as his sire used to call him, comes from a line of Nosferatu that came very close to being expelled from the Camarilla. It's some action committed by his great grand-sire. Only his sire had brought them back from the brink of, well extinction seems too grand of a term, more like gave them some honor that had been lost. 

He is one of the few Nosferatu in Minneapolis. There are a few others, but they are all his descendants or descendants of his sire. This change happened more than seven decades previous It's unclear if this was due to politics internal to the clan, blackmail, or trading favors. Nonetheless, if a Nosferatu aside from the Primogen acts, you can assume that Vox is behind it. He's also much more open and public than many of his clan. He has an uncanny knack for speaking aloud thoughts that others have only dared to ponder in the quiet solitude of their own minds. He's a dangerous kindred who is well respected if not a popular person to have as a guest.

The High Clans still have a problem with his line, but as the Vox, he's treated well. The same cannot be said for [[Sadie Wilhelm]], with whom he shares a grandsire. He offered her a home when she had deeply upset some Toreador in Boston. 

Osmont Lamirand certainly plays favorites, but appreciates the position and role the Harpy plays within the Camarilla. Guinea has come to enjoy speaking frankly and critically of those in power. There's a careful line to toe between reporting feelings of the Prince's subjects and treason. He reports the treason to the Prince.

His loyalty has been rewarded. Guinea imagines that the Prince believes that Guinea is in his debt, which he is, and that he doesn't want to do anything to disrupt his position has harpy, he doesn't.  That doesn't mean that Guinea is a fool. He considers all of the things he hears about the Prince. He knows the dangers of the court. There's always going to be danger, but the Twin Cities are home to Guinea, and his childer.

The Prince failing and being replaced isn't something he'd thought would happen. Or rather, he knew it could happen at any point, but the Tremere's hold on the city seemed both tight and eternal. He's become too comfortable. 

Now, like Khabira, he is playing voice to two courts. He's ultimately at the service of the Kindred in his home. He's not willing to lose the family that he has built here. 

He won't take any action until he's sure that he understands the lay of the land. He's also being a great deal more proactive in information gathering.
