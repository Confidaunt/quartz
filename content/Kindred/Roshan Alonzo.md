It's hard to find your place in the world. There are so many different paths that a person can take. They could lead to failure, to success, to death, to life everlasting. Roshan thought she'd found a decent groove that was easy to tread. There were lean times and feast times working as a leatherworker. 

She attended festivals, art shows, and renaissance fairs. It was a life. It seems so very hollow now that she knows what it means to have purpose. Roshan is good at what she does. She's good at finding the right person with the correct type of blood. It's satisfying, rewarding, and feeds into her new nature.

As sated as she is by what's she's doing, he company is lacking. The coterie in which she finds herself is distasteful. Kajus is cruel, Harrison is nepotism embodied, and Sadie is actually okay. Luckily the two assholes are all to happy to leave her to her work.

Both she and Sadie are away from the haven coterie when it burns. Roshan trusts Sadie enough to hide with her. Roshan's not here to be a tool, but Sadie has shown her nothing but respect.
