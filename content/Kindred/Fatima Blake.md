Fatima is a woman who enjoys a unity of purpose. She requires it. Her nature is well matched with the structure of the Tremere. Unfortunately for her, she was born both a woman, and too late to be an high level kindred within the structure of the pyramid. 

That just means that she's all the more focused on keeping her coterie in line. She is the queen of her larger than average coterie. There the high level Anarch Tremere who strayed, the Malkavian who she collected, a well trained Gangrel and a Ventrue hanger on.

She has power over them all in some way. Their coterie, her coterie, is the most cohesive in the Twin Cities, or so she tells herself. Order is mandated.

Everything comes apart with the bloodbonds. There is no structure in her house that can protect her from the beasts that she'd gathered close. Her end was quick, but hardly merciful. Matteo had so much to repay her for.
