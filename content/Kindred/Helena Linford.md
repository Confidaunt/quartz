A member of the Cappadocian whose existence was hidden by the Tzimisce while his clan was being hunted by the Giovanni. She's a philosophy professors that studies endings and deaths. She doesn't have a large footprint in the world of philosophy and easily exchanges new personas for old one when the need arises. She was embraced when she was middle aged and has straw blond hair with a scattering of gray hair in her current incarnation. She moonlights as a hospice advocate for dying humans so she can more deeply understand their beliefs as they near their end.
