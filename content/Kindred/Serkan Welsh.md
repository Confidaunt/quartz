The idea of being able to live forever is, well not the best thing ever, but pretty high up there. Serkan has a never ending client list, he gets to work with some truly amazing pieces, and the job changes from day to day. He's technically running an entire construction company as fronted through one of his ghouls. 

He did a bit of the partying and the politicking, but it hasn't been as meaningful as what he can do with his hand. Serkan will take breaks on occasion, make the tour of Elysium, but Nariel keeps him busy. 

One thing that Kindred are really good at, or perhaps, really bad at is keeping their environment intact. There's always word to be worked, holes to be patched, and tables to remove holes from(typically caused by fists or heads).

With the Tremere shit having gone all weird, Levi and Carter dead, Nariel is going to need all the help that he can get. He's not one to leave his friends hanging.
