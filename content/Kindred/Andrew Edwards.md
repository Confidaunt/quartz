Andrew Edwards has perfect confidence in his own abilities. This confidence is entirely unearned. Like many kindred in both the Ventrue and the Tremere, he's the benefactor of nepotism. 

He's in a coterie of decent standing. His coterie members respect him. He has everything going for him. None of the previous statements are true. His coterie is really only a coterie in name, with each member entirely self interested. Both Esther and Maryam command respect, but neither he nor Verity have much cache in the Twin Cities. 

[[Esther Vivo]] and [[Maryam Rouse]] are appropriate peers for a Ventrue of his standing. [[Verity Jiang]] is not a peer, she's a project.

He might have lived a bit longer if he hadn't spoken up and challenged Marrok. It's unlucky that Verity provoked him into speaking up. It's unfortunate that he shared a clan with the main competition for Praxis. It's most unfortunate that Andrew didn't really have any talent to speak of. Poor Andrew had no friends in the end. Not surprising really, he was kind of a dick.
