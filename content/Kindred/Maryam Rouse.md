Maryam is the leader of the Church of Cain in the Twin Cities.  She keeps to the Gnostic Convictions of Caine. Never unwillingly allow the Beast to take over. Never succumb to fear. Let nobody prevent you from growing closer to Caine. Feed only from hell's denizens. Do not consort with the lowest being of hell. Never brook an insult to Caine's divinity. 

Maryam is a Priest of Caine and provides services on Sunday nights. She knows that her position as Primogen is only because the Prince wanted to bring Lasombra to St. Paul. She is happy to serve Caine in any way He directs her too.

The attack on the Vienna Chantry is a tragic loss of life. It's also a chance to rally Caine's blood to the Truth and strike back at the denizens of hell who desire only to drag Caine's children from the path to salvation.

She will back whomever will serve Caine the best.
