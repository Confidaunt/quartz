Victoria builds, refines, and consolidates. She came up with nothing. Her sire had to fight for what she has and Victoria has continued the fight. Her sire lost her fight and Victoria came away from the shattering of that small city with few resources. Malkavian are a dangerous type.

Victoria hates to be without. If she doesn't have what she needs, it means that she didn't prepare properly. Every contingency must be carefully measured and accounted for. It's a thrill to have the perfect tool on hand when something seemly unexpected arises. Having something neatly in hand without expending even a slightly excessive amount of effort is how she choses to wield the strength of her coterie. 

She has a steady trade of secrets and favors along with a reputation of an hard-ass that will not fuck you over provided you won't do the same to her. There's always a price for any interaction with her, but she's got a lot to offer.

Ri challenged Victoria. Ri was a flexible and interesting opponent. Victoria is talented, but it takes time to bring her resources to bear. Aria waltzed into the middle of the ongoing fight between the two and brought Ri to the table. They listened as Aria laid out what they could do if they worked together. 

The Twin Cities has been a long process. There's been a lot of progress, but it's slowed to a snail's crawl in the last forty years. The coterie had been considering moving on for a while when the die was cast. 

Victoria had been building. Now she's ready to act.

Her coterie is taking in ghouls that have good secrets.
