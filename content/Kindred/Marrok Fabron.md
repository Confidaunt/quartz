Marrok Fabron is a man who values his quality of life. He eats what he wants, when he wants, and plays by the rules when he can't get away with breaking them. He's sensible, patient, and dramatic. 

He indulges because he has the power do to so. He trusts because he's strong enough to find and punish those who would betray him. He's made a comfortable life in the Twin Cities, and earned respect within the pyramid of the Tremere. 

When the Vienna Chantry fell, when the blood bonds broke, he was freed from the strong bonds keeping him in check. If Osmont wasn't such a weak willed follower, Marrok wouldn't have to act. 

There's no way that he can allow the Twin Cities to fall into the hands of any clan outside the Tremere. He's the best candidate within the clan in the city. How likely is it that an outside Tremere might appear right in their time of need after all?

A Tremere in charge of themselves. Stability in the face of uncertainty. Themes of consumption and orienting the Kindred of the Twin Cities in that direction. Acts in order to strength self first, then allies, then subjects. Leans into capitalism.
