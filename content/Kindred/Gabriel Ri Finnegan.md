Destruction is in Ri's nature. Her sire was an Anarch and she betrayed him to the Camarilla in order to gain entrance to the White Tower. Her first coterie fell apart due to her actions, but she came away blameless. She drifted from Camarilla city to Camarilla city, breaking things as she went. Sometimes it helped the Camarilla, sometime it hurt it. 

She's not terribly likely to start a fist fight. She doesn't scream rebellion against the man. She\'s happy within the Camarilla, but that\'s because it lets her feel out the cracks in the white tower. Gabriel Finnegan is a creature that loves destruction. She loves taking apart organizations, groups, hell, even governments. She is an active student of sabotage, sowing mistrust, and pushing just the right buttons to make everything come tumbling down. Most kindred who take an interest in her only manage to look this deeply with a great deal of effort.

When she came across Victoria, she found something that didn't break easily. Victoria held her attention, captivated her in what she could build. Ri was enjoying herself in the first time since forever. She found someone worth her attention and Ri enjoyed the time she spent as her enemy. Aria was a surprise when she suddenly appeared in Ri's haven one night. Aria saw Ri, saw what she was doing and how Victoria was responding and escalating. Aria understood. Aria explained, and she proposed. Ri was skeptical, but being in Victoria's presence without being attacked was enough of a draw to get her in the same room. 

The trio of them spoke through the night and held a true through the next day, spending it in Aria' haven. It was an excellent match. There were bumps, and it took time for Victoria and Ri to understand how not to step on each other's toes. Aria was there to keep the harmony. They can build and break some much more together than they could apart.

Ri's pretty sure that Aria would have killed her over the Primogen mess if they weren't in step. Ri's also pretty sure that Aria's enjoying watching her suffer through the ridiculous meetings and trying to herd her clan members in a given direction. 

When the Vienna Chanty falls, well Ri's never been more ready to ruin something. So long as she leaves something for Victoria to play with and space for Aria to play in the ashes, all will be well.
