Bernice probably shouldn't have been a Ventrue. Her nature seems to lend itself more to a Brujah that the careful discernment of a Ventrue. Bernice isn't aware of it, but she was on the radar of a Brujah who happened to be an enemy of her sire. She was turned just to spite the Brujah. 

Her sire was never one to waste resources and so she continued her life as a Kindred, but only as a tool for his ambitions. Bernice ultimately took the fall for on her her Sire's errors and she became a Ventrue without backing. 

She was desperate. There were few places that she would be welcome. Fatima took advantage of Bernice's position and offered her a sponsorship to reside in the Twin Cities. 

Maybe that's why she risked her life. The Twin Cities were her home. There was no way that she was going to let Fatima die and leave her stranded once again. Unfortunately she wasn't a match for the Mad Bitch. And so she died.
