Everything keeps changing for Jack. He started college this year, became a thinblood this year, killed a vampire this year, became a vampire this year. It's terrifying. Everything is so fucked. 

He left home because his parents were controlling assholes. They nearly kicked him out of the house when he got his ears pierced. It'd be kinda unfair to blame them for his enthusiastic 'descent' into a 'life of sin,' but screw it, they didn't help. Jack was lucky to get out of the house and into a good college. Dad wanted him to be a lawyer or some sort of white collar boss and mom wanted him to be a doctor. Jack hadn't had enough time to worry about it. Instead he signed up for the summer semester with their blessing and started living. He got more piercings, tattoos, smoked, drank, and barely scrapped by with a C for his first two classes. 

He stayed in the dorms through the summer break and did his best to get back on track. Jack wasn't stupid, he needed to get through college, then get a job, then he'd be free from his parents. 

A friend hooked him up with a really sweet connection to a party out in St. Paul. He wasn't exactly sure where it was, he wasn't the one driving, but it doesn't matter. His life up to then doesn't matter now.

Jack doesn't want to go home, but he still dreams of it. He daydreams about going back to college while lurking around nearly empty buildings throughout the day. Saveria is, well Mom would call her a peach. She's kind to him. Patient. She even told him that to everyone else it'd look like he'd withdrawn from the school, gotten a full refund of his tuition and left with a buddy who likewise hadn't been seen since. Jack wanted know what had happened to his buddy, but looking at Saveria, he knew he shouldn't ask. 

Saveria was still okay in Jack's books. The weird blood thing that made him really like her was gone, but she hadn't done anything really mean to him. Dani told Jack that it wouldn't have stayed that way for long. Jack hoped that it would have. He did know that he didn't want to keep playing guard duty for the rest of his life. Nadine was smart, scary, and a boss, but like in a good way. So when she told him what they were going to do, he was scared, but willing. He hadn't even killed anybody yet.

Jack feels strong. Jack is scared. But he has his friends, and together they'll be okay.
