Some people might say that Nadine is lucky to have come across a kindred that didn't kill her outright. They might say that thinbloods are a mistake and have no redeeming qualities except for the ability to sometime walk in the daylight, making them superior to ghouls for guarding sleeping Kindred. They might further say that Victoria Simms isn't someone to get into bed with if you want to come out whole on the other side. Many people are idiots.

Nadine had a good idea of what value she was to a kindred. She'd been playing daywatch to some Anarchs that had been passing through the Twin Cities quietly. Not quietly enough as the Scourge of Minneapolis came by during the night and ended them. Nadine fled to the outskirts and watched. She listened and she waited. She thought she was doing it quietly enough when a brightly colored Brujah, a curious Toreador and a Ventrue giving GILF were waiting for her in the shitty apartment she'd been renting. It was an overwhelming show of force for little ol her. 

Victoria explained to her in small words that she was to be killed for having been made. Thinbloods weren't permitted within the city. But maybe there was something that could be gained. If Nadine agreed to become Victoria's agent, Victoria and her coterie would do their level best to fully turn her and extricate her after a given set of time. Seeing as this wasn't a negotiation, Nadine agreed. Victoria took precautions. She removed Nadine's memory of the deal and smoothed away Nadine's previous life as an Anarch thinblood. 

Nadine was presented to Prince Osmont Lamirand as a person guardian for whatever he deemed important. There was also a proposal of further bonded thinblood who could likewise withstand the sun to be at Osmont's personal direction. This gift and proposal offended many at Elysium and earned Victoria the position of Primogen of the Ventrue. She was correct to shape Nadine's memories as the Prince demanded that the bond be surrendered to a Tremere. Nadine passed a number of terrible tests. She was watched night and day, and she loved Prince Osmont more than life itself. 

When the blood bond, several implanted suggestions triggered and Nadine was free to fully be herself once again. (So she believes) Nadine knew what diablerie was before she was given over to the court. She wasn't sure what was happening, and if Victoria would be in a position to extricate her. Besides, Nadine had a new coterie to look after. So she explained what it was to drink a kindred through it's death and they did. They drank their fill. Expect for Kamran. She let him down. She wouldn't let anyone else get hurt. Maybe Kamran is still there. She can't rest until she's sure he's gone.
