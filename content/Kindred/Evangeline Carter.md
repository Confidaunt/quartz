Is this how all the kine she fed from felt, Evie asks herself as she dies the second time. She struggled at first. She tried to pry Enzo from herself and flee as Leon did, but she's not the one with physical talents in the coterie. 

She always knew that Leonardo DuPont was a massive piece of shit, but being proven right in this case hasn't brought her any peace. So instead of fighting, she let herself be eaten. She poured as much of herself into Enzo as possible. She looked into her killer's souls as it strained and cried and did her best to ease his pain and keep the parts of herself intact. She cooperated in the process and still, she lost a great deal.  She was largely intact as she flowed into Kamran, and helped Enzo overwhelm the idiot thin-blood who would dare interfere with her vengeance.

The world is a strange place now, but Enzo doesn't push her away.
