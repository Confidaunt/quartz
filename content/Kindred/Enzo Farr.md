Enzo knows he's playing with fire. How else could you explain living in a war-zone. It's supposed to be better here in the Twin Cities, but Enzo figure's it's just different. Places are easier to defend with all of the Tremere's blood magic, but it's also harder to pivot and defend places that haven't been hardened against the Sabbat. 

And that's just the external enemies. The who idea of living in a Tremere city is a bad one on the whole. They're strangely connected to each other while also being as stuck up as a Ventrue. Not cool. Leon's also the worst one. Probably not actually, but the Kindred looks at Enzo like he's the worst thing he's ever tasted. 

Evie, different problem, Evie and him keep away from Leon. Evie is pretty cool actually. She's nice, loud, and up for a good time, but that's about the only thing that they share. So hanging out in an infrequent thing with Evie and a never thing with Leon. 

Enzo never pretended to be something that he wasn't. He likes to fight, to fuck and to eat. Evangeline was sweet, gorgeous, a good lay, then boring. She found him boring too, so that was for the best. They would party together sometimes. The biggest thing that both of them shared was the dislike of the third member of their coterie, the fucking stuck up Tremere. 

Enzo didn't want to eat Evie. Enzo also wasn't a match for the angry and prepared Leon fuckface to weaken him with blood magic and ensnare him with magic to force him to diablerize her. It wasn't fair what he did to Evangeline with Enzo's hands. Enzo came back to himself after having drained her dry. He hadn't wanted to and the fuck was he going to take the fall for diablerie on Leon The Cunt's behalf. 

He's so fucked. He's so extremely fucked. He panics. Leon is in the wind by this point and the haven's on fire. Enzo panics. He runs. The fire is only added motivation. 

Of course it's just the cap on his shit night that he runs into the once thin-blooded day guard that Enzo knows diablerized one kindred each. He runs, but they catch him. Even though he is gorged on Evie, even though he hears her tears in his blood, Kamran drinks him down. Enzo's very nature eats him back in turn. Now he's a beast twice over. He's able to escape by the skin of his new teeth, but only just. 

Everything is terrible. He's going to fucking kill Leon.
