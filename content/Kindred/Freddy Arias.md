Freddy is a Tremere and that means more than you might think. Freddy came from a good home, from the right church, and married the right girl. His life which was supposed to be so full wasn't. He was miserable. 

He started drinking more, and cheating. His daughter was born, but he couldn't feel anything for her. He stayed away from home more and more and did his best to present a strong face within his company. His dedication was noticed. He was invited on a private retreat where he tragically died. 

In truth, a Tremere had been keeping an eye on him for a while and liked what he saw. A man broken by the world. A man willing to fall into line. And that's what Freddy was. He fit into the whole and was unhappy. 

The structure kept him in line, but he remained miserable. He was productive, but unkind to those under him. All he could do was move forward into the unending night. 

When the Vienna Chantry fell, he felt so much for the first time in so long. He was overwhelmed and perhaps engaging in some emotional growth when he was diablerized by Jack Marsh.
