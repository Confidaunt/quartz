He's a very young kindred, only turned 20 years previously. He was living an indulgent lifestyle full of blackout drinking, parties and drugs. He attracted the attention of a Ministry kindred after he caused someone to overdose and then show up the next night to party. He was picked up by the Tzimisce after being neglected by his sire and bribed by the Tzimisce.
