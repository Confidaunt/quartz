Zafirah needs to record how she's feeling on her own skin. She's tried different types of pen, markers, knives, and inks. The best method that she has found is tattooing. Zafirah has quite a following in the tattoo world and has ghouled an up and comer to reach the places that she cannot. She is a forever canvas. As she heals, the ink is squeezed out of her skin, ready to be wiped away and replaced with something new. The way that she heals tells her secrets.

There will always be more to learn. You can never know everything. Why should anyone try to learn more than they know if they can never know everything? Well it depends. There are several arguments that could be put forward to this question. It's unclear if there is a correct answer. Is it possible that there could be many correct answers? Can two of those answers be diametrically opposed?

So many questions, so many answers. When they matter, it's all they do. When they don't matter, it's just flotsam and jetsam. It's hard to know which questions matter when the answers that rise in her skin are the ones that want to be heard. 

Elijah is a question/answer/call/response/proper/improper/present/absent. Elijah has been in her past and will be in her future. He's not always in her now, which is good as it's hard to function when he is. The answers are so loud that they questions can't be asked.
