To hate what you are is a freedom that Saveria Di Traglia didn't have about forty years previous. She was unhappy within Tremere's Pyramid, but it was something that was soothed by the bloodbonds that existed between all of the Tremere. Her purpose was something that was given to her and her happiness was derived from it. How good of a servant was she being? Disgusting. 

She thought she was going to die when she was kidnapped those forty years previous. She was nearly certain of it. She was a talented and came from a respected Tremere bloodline. When she laid eyes on Elijah, oh the horror that coursed through her. Some from what she'd been taught, but also just a primal fear that stirred in her when something so old was considering her. A good deal of her blood was drained with an unfamiliar sorcery. Saveria tried to resist when she was forced to take part in a ritual that broke her from the pyramid. The Tzimisce, the Kindred that should be her enemy, kissed her on the forehead and taught her the ritual that would hide her freedom from her brethren. Saveria isn't a fool. She could feel a bond in the blood that she drank, but it was a faint thing, fragile when compared to how she'd been existing since she died. 

Elijah told her that she had a week to decide what she wanted to do, join him, or go back to the life that she was living before. Saveria told him that she didn't need a week. Elijah's wide smile didn't change. 

"Very well little deviant, together we will pull the Tremere down from their Pyramid." Saveria was reflexively horrified, but took a moment to investigate the feeling. There was nothing of her in it. There was only was she'd been taught. 

"Honorable Elder, despite my feelings on the Tremere, there is some sense in the order that the Camarilla imposes." Saveria wasn't a fool. The Sabbat wasn't something wanted to support.

"I do not take part in the squabbles between the rabble, the tower and the freemen. My interests are my own. We share a goal, and for now that is enough."

Saveria was returned a few hours after she was taken and made excuses for herself. She found herself in a new coterie a little more than a year later and was delighted to find that she was among friends of Elijah. She'd spend the next many years both reporting on the activities of the Twin Cities and learning more about the vaults that held the Tremere treasures.
