Osmont is an ancient creature of structure and pattern. He knows his place in this world, and it's at the top. Those below him are destined to serve him, just as he is destined to serve the greater pattern of the pyramid. Other clans are too free and diverse in their patterns of thinking. 

That's not to say that there is no creativity within the pyramid, or that he isn't permitted to experiment. Indeed, the Twin Cities are themselves an experiment in the collection of blood from diverse clans that wouldn't normally be accessible to the Tremere on the whole. 

Minneapolis is a bastion of Kindred civilization and St. Paul is a series of patterns modeled after it. This allows both the order of the Tower and the studies of the Tremere be utilized to the utmost. The White Tower in Minneapolis is strong, as is the Pyramid that serves it. While not at the forefront of all research into blood magic, the Twin Cities play an important part in testing the uses for vitae from clans outside the Camarilla, interacting with other talents in the magics that Kindred have access too, and allowing trade of unusual items that are otherwise difficult to procure. 

Those that reside within St. Paul are carefully managed in order to keep them from consolidating. Two different Anarch coteries that had been permitted in the city thirty years previous joined up with outside and unwelcome bands to try and launch an attack on the Vaults. They were soundly rebuked, and the wayward Tremere was returned to his position in the pyramid, if a bit reduced. Since then, the Anarch presence in St. Paul has been limited. This is a cycle that has repeated with other groups since he had implemented the more permissive pattern in St. Paul.

There has been a build up of Kindred in the Twin Cities since the Sabbat started it's most recent campaign. But now the threat seems over, or they have turned their attention elsewhere. It's time to reward the loyal and expel those who have nothing to offer. It's always a painful balancing act, but one he's completed many times.

First he rewards by granting wealth, property, and boons. Then there is a round of the rights of creation. If a kindred has received neither, it's an unsubtle acknowledgement of their lack. Should they persist in their presence beyond a year or two without a serious boon, they will be socially iced out. All favors that they owe will be called in, any debt that they hold will be paid out in some manner. If they still persist, they will receive a visit from Khabira, then the Seneschal, then the Scourge.

But none of that matters now. The structure is broken. He can feel himself above the others that he was so intertwined with. His princedom burns. There is nothing for it. There is nothing for him. He is by himself for the first time that he can remember. Aldric is not enough. There is nothing that is enough.
