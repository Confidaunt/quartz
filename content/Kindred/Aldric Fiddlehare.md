The strict control over the Twin Cities is a beautiful thing. The Camarilla's answer to how to rule is one of many, but it's the best of those available by far. Power is meant to be wielded and controlled. It would be best to have the other clans pressed into the Camarilla, but it is not the job of the Camarilla to absorb them. Rather the Camarilla must be the white tower on the hill that calls all to it's walls and to it's defense against the madness of the world. 

With the loss of his beloved Osmont, his legacy is in danger. Aldric supported Marrok's ascension and he must continue the path if he doesn't want to disgrace and disrupt what the Tremere could be once again. They are a beautiful thing in their structure, but now that they've come apart, they've lost the one thing that made them truly powerful. 

Discarding the Tremere as a whole is foolish. Cutting down any who stray is necessary.

Aldric Fiddlehare is the Seneschal of the Twin Cities and a member of the Prince's Court, [[Cour Des Savants]]. He is obviously a first nations kindred. He's an active member of the Ojibwe tribe. He was embraced due to his perceived heroism by a French Ventrue during the French's interest in the Minnesota area.

He is Prince [[Osmont Lamirand]]'s lover. There's a perception that he's the one pulling the Prince's strings, but it's a ploy by the both of them by feigning weakness. 

[[Khabira Rehman]] is the Herald of the Prince's Court. Aldric is relatively certain that she's more loyal to another master than to the Prince, but it's a low enough position that he can wait for her to make a mistake before acting against her. She is well liked by the kindred in Minneapolis which gives her a not insignificant amount of social credit. 

[[Lai Da]] is the Bruja Scourge. Despite this she is relatively well liked. This is more due to the relatively stability of Minneapolis than to her position. She has started to get a bit restless after a period of quiet.

[[Marrok Fabron]] is the new acting Prince of Minneapolis. Osmont would want Aldric to be both safe and stable politically. Marrok is however, incredibly grating. Aldric is chaffing under the reduced access to both knowledge and power.

[[Vox Sanguinis]] is one of the few Nosferatu in the city. He's a dangerous kindred who is well respected if not a popular person to have as a guest. Vox would also be the first to voice opposition to any attempt at a new status quo.
