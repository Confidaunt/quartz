Being the Keeper of Elysium is a thankless job. Even in such a well behaved Princedom, there are always troublemakers. It's even worse when Elysium is held in the mixed company of St. Paul. 

When the rules of Elysium are broken, and they certainly are, it's Candon that puts a stop to it. He confers with the Prince, Lai Da, and August on an appropriate punishments. Sometimes, if the Prince is in a mood, the decree of punishment comes from on high.

Despite the job being a thankless one, it gives him both status and power. The world is stable when one has both of those. He'd be lying if he said that he didn't enjoy the look of panic and anger on the kindred he caught.

Nothing is the same after the destruction of the Vienna Chantry. The prince is somehow fundamentally broken. Candon's position is more uncertain than it's been in decades. No longer does he need to be the one that prowls the Elysium reminding kindred that the Camarilla is strong and watching, instead he's a guard dog for a deeply wounded sect. He has the feeling that the only reason he hasn't been replaced is because the White Tower is already on shaky ground. 

He's protecting the Elysium near the vault when Ilya attacks and tries to break into the vault. He meet the true death at her hand.
