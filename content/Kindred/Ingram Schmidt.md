To be a Toreador interested in accounting and money as much as he is, might give some initial confusion to a kindred that doesn't know Ingram. If you spend more than a hour around the man, you'll quickly find that the man doesn't just love money, more than that, he's inspired by how it flows and moves in the world. Really it's the numbers that the money represents, but that's semantics.

Anarch are fine. They sometime have something interesting going on, but they seem to have a hard time keeping money in hand long enough to be inspiring. The Sabbat are simply too dangerous to associate with. Autarks tend to be about fifty-fifty.

Ingram is a relatively unknown face in the United States, having come over from Europe sometime in the previous seventy years. He quietly invites himself into an Elysium, asks around and quickly makes himself neigh indispensable. 

He is very much like a Toreador in other ways. Passion is what fundamentally drives Ingram. If there isn't something interesting or inspiring in his work, well then he's just not interested in it. 

It was his passion that led Ingram to uncovering the leavings of a very powerful elder. He just couldn't help himself, and Ingram presented himself to Elijah and asked if he could take a quick look at his finance. Both concerned and bemused, Elijah invited him in as a guest. Ingram was an excellent guest, and now is something between a contractor and a friend of Elijah. 

The work is always good.
