Chester is a man who loves his family. He can't live without them. He's watched over them, doted on them and ensured their wellbeing. Most all of them live simple and quiet lives. 

Every sixty years or so, he as a young man, happens across an unattached member of his family and they fall deeply in love. Unfortunately his work bind him to a mostly nightly schedule, but every so often he's able to make daylight hours work. 

Elijah has been kind enough to help him live the life that Chester wants, and for that, Chester is unendingly loyal. Elijah understands what it is to need someone, wholly and completely. 

Chester and his coterie, In Red, is a relatively new one. He has availed himself and his ghoul of the services of Kanpeki to ensure that the duplicity isn't found out. Minneapolis is a new city for the Alvera family.
