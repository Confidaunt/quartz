The Tzimisce's greatest work. They are able to pick up any clan's discipline by feeding deeply on blood of a given type. They have diablerized many, but the Tzimisce removes all of the unwanted and unneeded memories and soul pieces, mostly. They do not remember being alive, nor do they care about it. They are agender.
