Kills and harvests their coterie to break into the vaults and take the knowledge they\'ve been denied for too long. They kill the Keeper of Elysium, gather sacred tomes, and flee into the unending night. They're actually hiding in the suburbs of Minneapolis, needing to retrieve further items from the Tremere vault now that they've learned of them. 

Character Ideas: 
64 to 7, line 4 and 6

Remaining correct brings good results, regret vanishes; rising up to conquer
the barbarians, in three years one will have the reward of a great country.

To "feast quietly" is to nourish oneself in a seemly manner. The idea is to calmly
consolidate your gains-- rest easy and don't be greedy for more than you already possess. Ritsema/Karcher's advice from the Judgment: "In order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events," is especially appropriate here.

Strategic withdrawal is not surrender.

The great leader has orders, to establish states and families; do not
employ petty people.
