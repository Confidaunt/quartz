Phyllis tried, she really did, but she couldn't save her coterie. They were attacked by the Sabbat four years previously and she was the only survivor. The Prince blamed her. No one wanted to take her in, but Ilya volunteered. The Midwest is not somewhere you want to be a lone Kindred, much less a lone Camarilla. 

She kept trying to prove herself and only lost further standing. Ilya was so kind to her. She's the only one that Phyllis can trust. So when Phyllis asks if Ilya's okay, she believes her.
