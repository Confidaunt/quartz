Yustina is a strange one. That can be said of many Malkavian. She has a strange appreciation of curves and a dislike of sharp angles and straight lines. She appreciates the structure of the pyramid. She has a strong preference for working within Tremere cities. She came to Minneapolis specifically to work for Osmont Lamirand. In truth, the alignment of values and purpose that come from the bloodbonds is something that she craves.

She often works with others in small groups in her position as the Sherriff, but none of them are satisfactory for long. Many are close, so close, but don't fit together correctly. There's a pattern that they should fall along, but it never works correctly.

Yustina is brilliant at detecting things that don't belong and finding flaws in the patterns of the world. 

Yustina knows that Osmont didn't step down, but she mourns with him. The breaking of the blood bonds that webbed the Tremere together is a terrible thing. 

Marrok Fabron is the best chance for Minneapolis staying in Tremere hands, even if her heart aches ever time she sees a Tremere with the sharp angles of broken blood bonds trailing out into the ether. Marrok is also the one who acted against Osmont. 

Now she must decide the best course of action.
