Khabira Rehman is the Herald of the Prince's Court. She's the most recent addition, having only served for three decades. She is well liked by the kindred in Minneapolis which gives her a not insignificant amount of social credit. This is not surprising as she leans into her Toreador blood.

Khabira is one of those Kindred that seem to have it all. Most of her nights are spent being tended to by her small cadre of ghouls and working as a sculptor in a quiet studio. Some nights she's out on the Prince's business carrying news to Kindred that are forced to bow and scrape. She often gets veiled threats that she happily reports to both the Prince and Yustina. 

The attack on the Vienna Chantry means fewer nights to herself and a higher likelihood of being required to fight. Marrok Fabron and Victoria Simms would both make fine princes in her estimations. Khabira will side with whichever group is the most likely to win. In the meantime she's be pulling double duty as a messenger between the two and to two different courts.

All she wants is to continue her nights uninterrupted by fighting for her existence. And to be in on the gossip. And maybe have more kindred groveling to her. The simple things in these cruel nights.
