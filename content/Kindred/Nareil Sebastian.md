Nareil Sebastian is one of the busiest Kindred in the the Twin Cities. She's in charge of the ghouls that serve the Camarilla in the Twin Cities. That might sound unimportant, but it\'s not. Mostly it\'s just a lot of thankless work. Ghouls are assigned to her and they ensure that messages are sent, goods moved, meetings arranged, and secrets kept. Her coteries supports her in this, but also have their own duties.

Nareil knows her place in the pyramid. She's here to keep things running. She's here to ensure that things don't spiral out of control. There is always some nigh Masquerade ruining error that is just waiting in the wing for her to handle. 

Nareil is a high generation, female Tremere. She's also the third most powerful Tremere in the city. Nareil knows where the bodies are buried and who hates who. She also doesn't give a single fuck about it ask long as a kindred cleans up after themself or asks for her help before things go utterly to shit.

She has a much power as she does because she doesn't play politics within the Camarilla. Nariel is here to shore up the defense of the White Tower, make sure that everyone is well fed, and ready to conjure just the right ghoul for a given task.

The failure of the blood bonds was the worst day in Nariel's life and death. Not because there was a loss of purpose, or because she was repressed, or actually just felt like murdering everyone, but because half of her workforce disappeared overnight. 

She's hamstrung now. She's scrabbling for balance with half her fingers missing. There is nothing for it but to get working.
