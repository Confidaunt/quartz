Sadie Williams does a stout trade in secrets for blood. Sadie doesn't want to be in the Twin Cities. Sadie wants to be back in Boston where there's more everything going on. She wants to go back to how it was before she was foolish enough to get caught selling secrets about the Toreador Primogen to his Gangrel political opponent. 

The Toreador didn't have enough pull to seriously harm her, but he was able to pressure both the Prince and the Nosferatu Primogen into removing her from her coterie and revoking her domain. She could still feed from the Commons, but it wasn't something she could tolerate. 

Guinea invited her to the Twin Cities where he'd recently ascended to Harpy. Sadie is pretty sure accepting the invitation was one of the worst things she'd ever done. There was a bit of maneuvering against other Nosferatu who were still upset about something that their grandsire had done. Sadie was awarded Primogen as a Harpy shouldn't hold two positions.

After that it was exhausting. There was nothing to do. Sadie was unhappy. The Prince was pleased with both her and her cousin and allowed them to create a childe each. Vito inherited her restlessness, but her cousin had no trouble with his childe.  It came to the point where Sadie had to present her angry childe to court and the Prince released her. Vito hasn't willingly spoke to her since. 

So here she is, in this place that she hates, with a title she doesn't want and she can't leave. Not really, not unless she want's to live somewhere worse. Sadie needs to find something that will grant her position in a new court without getting herself into a more miserable situation. 

Then the Twin Cities became interesting. 

Fuck.

Roshan and the pile of secrets that the new prince is sitting on top of could be her ticket out of here. Stay or go?
