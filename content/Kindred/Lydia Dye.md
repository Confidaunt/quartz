Lydia watches. She watches and waits for the trail of death to lead her to the truth. Nothing can be allowed to interfere. She will watch as the death is handed from one kindred to the next. She will follow it until it ends.

Death is a constant unbroken line. It weaves and winds throughout the world and time and everything. Murder is a special kind of death. Murder of a Kindred even more so, even if it seems a more frequent occurrence in the long nights as compared to the world of the Kine. 

Her sire thought she was Caitiff. So did she for a long time. Lydia didn't let that stop her. The label weighed heavily on her, but she found a lover and companion in a fellow Caitiff. The Prince in her sire's city tolerated her because of love for her sire, but her lover had no such protection. 

Her lover's sire left as soon as it was clear that she was also a Caitiff. The Sheriff came around one night and killer her lover. It was then that Lydia's Malkavian nature reared it's head. She hated the sheriff with every single piece of her being, but the sheriff carried the murder of Lydia's beloved. So she stalked him. She would not leave his side. She was nearly thrown out until her sire presented her at an Elysium and declared her madness. The sheriff was ordered to tolerate her and so he did. 

Now you may ask why Lydia didn't kill the Sheriff herself? Because that would truly be the end of her beloved. Instead, if she watched him die, watched him be murdered, then the line continued. It took nearly four years for the Sheriff to be killed by an Anarch. And so she went to the Anarch. 

She does not serve those who hold the thread to her beloved, but she is willing to work with them to a certain extent. She will never raise a hand in either their defense or to harm them. She's there to witness. 

Fatima got lucky one night, and Lydia had been with her since. It was more surprising that the Tremere hadn't fallen to one of the many Sabbat attacks. But the blood bonds broke and Matteo had immediately attacked Fatima.

Bernice tried to interfere with Matteo who compelled Lydia to come to his defense. Lydia tried to resist, to remain an observer, but Matteo's ability with Dominate exceeded her own talents. Or maybe she missed her beloved, and was eager to be closer to the act of murder. 

In the end, Matteo carries the line, and she will watch him until he's murdered. The unrest in the Twin Cities makes it more likely to happen sooner rather than later.
