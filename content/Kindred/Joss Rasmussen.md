Joss's family came from French stock in Minneapolis that never got over the Louisiana purchase. Joss cared about it until he was embraced and realized that the borders that mortals drew didn't matter much to the things that lurk the the night and worse, the things that now hunted him. Joss toured the lands of North America and even dipped towards the equator, but ultimately, his homeland called him back. He didn't care much for the small politics of Kindred society. Joss was a kindred of his word and stayed in line. The orderly style of the Camarilla grated at times, but it ensured that he had allies to call on when serious threats were faced.

Joss is a man that values both new experiences and security. There should always be somewhere safe that can be fallen back to in the case of some danger arising. For the last few decades that's been the Twin Cities. He was able to travel with his coterie to other places, delivering things at the whims of the Tremere.

It's become cloying. Fatima seems to be winding other Kindred to her ever tighter. It's only by her grace that he's allowed to remain within the coterie and now that the attacks by the Sabbat are waning, so is his political power outside of what Fatima permits him. Joss is muscle for his coterie, but in keeping with his independent streak, slept the days apart from the others. He is there to be sure that the little Tremere doesn't get herself into trouble she couldn't get out of. 

He hasn't been outright asked to leave, but there are signs that are his star is on the descent. Joss doesn't doubt that he could find a home elsewhere, but to have some time away from fighting would be a welcome relief. 

When the bloodbonds of the Tremere break, there is greater madness in the Camarilla than he's ever seen before. The Camarilla was always a comfort to him. An ordered place that could always offer safety, but now the Twin Cities offer no such relief. 

He heads towards the Anarch West Coast. His sire, while aggressive at times, would never turn him away. Perhaps in time the Twin Cities will resettle into order.
