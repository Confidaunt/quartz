Lai Da is a killer. Most of the time, a scourge is a kindred held back, on the edges of the court. Scourges are meant to be feared. They're the big stick so the Prince can walk quietly.

Not Lai Da. Lai Da is a loud and friendly kindred. She cleaves tightly to the Traditions and obeys the orders of the Prince. Rarely does the Prince call for the execution of one of the Camarilla members, but when he does, Lai Da carries it out without delay. She's not cruel and does her best to do quick and clean work. 

She spent the last two decades leading teams against the Sabbat that attacked and invaded the Twin Cities. She keeps the city calm and quiet so the Magicians can do their work in peace. Lai has also lead a very successful series of attacks against the Sabbat's interests in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. In between attacks she was hunting the Thin-Blooded leavings of unwelcome Anarchs, Sabbat, and any other Kindred that tried their luck in her home. She and her Beast are very in sync with one another.

This has only improved her standing in the Twin Cities. She's strong and loyal and honorable. She's an oddity in this world. She has started to get a bit restless after a period of quiet.
