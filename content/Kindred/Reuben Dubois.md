Reuben was born to money, died with more and has been growing his wealth since. He enjoys having effects on other, in fact his feeding restriction is that he can only feed from those who he has seriously aided. Don't misunderstand him. He does good because he enjoys the power that it gives him over others and for no other reason. He has many strong connections in the mortal world with positive groups.

Reuben gives. That is who and what he is. He gives to those he cares for, to those who are correct in deed, for those who experience misfortune. He is a friend to those whom are without. His friends are many, but as many as they are, they are small, weak, unorganized. 

It doesn't bother Reuben. He gives because he can. And what he gives, he receives in gratitude, in good will, and in favors he hardly needs to ask for. The young kindred of the Twin Cities regard him as a friend. The old kindred as a threat. To them it appears he is grooming the young to act as his allies in the future. That's certainly a benefit, but not his goal.

Reuben, like many kindred, does what he wants, when he wants, and woe be to any who try to stop him. He had been considering leaving the Twin Cities with Andca. There was a promising invitation to London that would have enjoyable, but then Marrok offer up a childe of his bloodline, freshly released into the world. It would be against his nature to leave you Jacques hanging. Reuben's continued presence in the city kept Victoria Simms's claim to Primogen threatened, if not in real jeopardy. 

So Reuben stayed. Then the Tremere broke. It is tempting to stay, so tempting. A city is crisis is such a lovely place to be.
