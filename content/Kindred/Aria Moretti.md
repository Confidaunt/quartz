Aria grew up being told no. A little black girl in New York during the 1900\'s was a hard life, especially when she wanted to tell stories on Broadway. She was on stage in when she caught the eye of her sire, and once she spoke with him, she captured his heart. Aria was responsible for some of the great successes of black culture on Broadway before a rival of her sire drove them both from the City. Furious, Aria lashed out at her sire and she hasn't seen him since. 

Aria's carrying a lot of baggage, but do all Kindred. She's used to struggling against the world, society, her sex, her race, everything that's stacked against her. It's hard to not view everything set in front of her as a challenge to be conquered, a threat to be dealt with, a enemy wearing the face of an ally. 

Unlike many kindred, Aria aware of her biases. Her issues dog her, but she isn't one to let the beast rule her. It is permitted when she does find the flesh of an enemy close enough to bite down on, but not otherwise. She's a vicious thing, but doesn't have the reputation as such.

Her coterie at times is frustrating, but she is well aware there is greater strength and kinship together than they ever could be apart. It was still biting when Ri was named Primogen for Brujah when Aria was trying for Primogen of the Toreador. It was a tactical political move that was both an insult to Ri with only five Brujah in the city and prevented Victoria from getting more power through Aria's status. 

Aria's not a fool. The Tremere are the power in the city, and they like to throw their power around. The coterie has been binding it's time, gathering resources, power and status. They are well regarded enough that they would be welcomed in nearly any Camarilla city. And so Aria waits. Something will change, and the Good Times will roll.
