Jeremiah Giles is a young kindred, but he's been fighting since the start. He was an unsanctioned childe of a desperate sire trying to hold onto an important stronghold in Texas. The Prince was willing to overlook his sire's action as it was only his sire's action, and the loss of more than 7 childe over the span of a month that kept an important elder's resting place safe from Sabbat.

Ilya was one of the Kindred that came to relieve his sire. There were strong blood wards that were still dangerous enough to burn through shovelheads, but would have eventually been exhausted. 

Ilya invited him to join her and he did. He found his feet on the streets hunting Sabbat members that threatened the Twin Cities. He grew into a real kindred in that time. 

The city's crazy now, but Ilya's still on top of shit as she ever was.
