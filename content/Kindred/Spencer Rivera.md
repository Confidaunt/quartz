Spencer is a security expert that breaks into sites for fun and profit. She's an adjunct professor that teaches as the mood strikes her.

Ingram really gets his fingers into the most interesting places. Spencer worked with him about twenty years back and she got inducted into Elijah's service pretty quickly. He gave her the shape that she should have been born with. 

She's in it for the money and the access to interesting places. Spencer is also the one that tipped off Elijah that there was someone watching people on Schrecknet. Spencer thought that it was probably the Sabbat spying. She was wrong. 

Spencer feels some guilt over it. There are a lot of people, actual people, not Cam assholes, that got hurt over it. Water under the bridge. Spencer now trying to gather intel on the Second Inquisition.
