Stories are what humans make. Vampires are still human, despite what 'Kindred' claim. There is nothing that a human is that a vampire isn't. There's the magical parts, and the dark instinct of the Beast, yet there are terrible human killers and monsters of every variety that can be found in Kindred.

So kindred also make stories. Their stories can be longer, but fundamentally, humans and kindred tell the same kinds of stories. Lewis doesn't discriminate between human stories and kindred stories. There are challenges in both types of stories. 

Ingram reached out to Lewis sixty years previously and asked Lewis if he wanted to hear the story of an Elder. Lewis immediately agreed. There was a prolonged conversation lasting more than two months before he reached an agreement with Elijah. So long as Lewis assisted Elijah in ways that would not endanger Lewis's life, Elijah would answer any question he asked truthfully. 

It's a hard deal. But there hasn't been a thorough telling of a Tzimisce story in a long time. In the meantime, he's arranged a job at the University teaching folklore and storytelling.
