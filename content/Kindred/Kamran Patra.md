Kamran really should have said no. There were so many points in his life, ha, when he could have said no. He could have said no to surgeries, to experimental medication, to years of suffering, to pain, so much pain. But he said yes. The will to live is a terrible thing. Kamran has endured so much more than he ever wanted to.

When a stranger came to his bedside promising health, he accepted. It wasn't the first time a priest, spirit healer, or some other person toting a crock of shit had come by. Kamran had no reason to think that this wouldn't be the same. Another, 'Yeah, sure', and another promise broken. But this one wasn't. He woke up the next day feeling amazing.

His long time roommate goggled at him as Kamran stood and walked around the room, trying to discern what smelled so good. He wish he could say that he came back to himself afterwards, seeing the blood on his hands and shaken by action. Instead he walked to his roommate, grasped him in a tight hug and nuzzled into his neck. He didn't release him until he was drained dry. 

Kamran was crying in the corner when the stranger came back. She wore a wide smile and offered her wrist to him. It pulsed with life and again, he took her offer. Twice now he should have said no to her. After an all too brief drink she took his hand in hers and they walked out into the sunlight together. She explained what would be expect of him now. His health for his life. He didn't say no. 

War was terrifying. It wasn't even a proper war. He was so afraid all the time of being attacked. He smoked and drank and trembled. He wondered if death wouldn't be better. But then his thoughts would return to her and he'd find the strength to carry on.

The bond broke. She wasn't enough anymore. He said yes to Nadine and the Stargazers more out of habit than anything. Kamran attacked the fleeing kindred only once his friend held him down. He hit his neck, but he didn't fight. Kamran's a coward in the end. It was easier to let go than to explain anything. Kamran finally said no.
