Jacque was only recognized as a neonate three years previous. His Childehood was a standard length. Tremere often keep their childe in moderate isolation to ensure that their standards are met. Jacque is good a being a Tremere. He's good at following orders and not shirking his duty. He's uncomfortable that he feels warmth in his chest when an elder Tremere compliments him. 

Andca and Reuben were a bit of a shock to Jacque. After so long being surrounded and shaped and pushed and formed, to met an artist who cared for Jacque's opinions and another who seemingly wanted to assist him without strings attached, it was foreign. Marrok explained to Jacque that he was invited to Minneapolis to test his wings and that he was expected to bring the other members of the coterie closer in line with the Tremere. There'd been a rumor that they were considering moving on. Jacque didn't see how adding a Tremere minder would assist in that.

When the blood bonds broke and the Chantry fell, it was like he was dying all over again. Jacques heart became suddenly lonely. No longer was he buoyed by the worry that he would let down the Prince and Marrok. No longer did he think fondly of the night that Marrok introduced himself and praised him for being a talent the Tremere would be proud of.

Andca came to him as he wept. He comforted him and brought him to Reuben who offered comfort in the form of Jacque's favorite kine, stressed students. His coterie was kind to him. He knows that Marrok expects him to fall into line, but Jacques doesn't want that. What Jacques wants isn't clear even to himself, but it isn't what he had before.
