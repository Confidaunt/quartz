Ventrue have a tendency towards gaining and showing power. Kajus is one of the worst kinds of those Ventrue. Power is meant to be wielded. Power should be gathered, taken, stolen, extracted from those who aren't strong enough to use it correctly. 

The Tremere in the city are weak. They have power and all they want to do with it is play make believe with fools too weak to join the White Tower. All Kindred here are interested in doing is playing with their books and their blood. It's pretty fucking sad. 

It's also pretty profitable to deal in blood. Kajus has his token Tremere in Harrison, his bloodhound in Roshan, and his fixer in Sadie. Harrison is neatly under his thumb, Roshan gives up with enough pressure and Sadie's fucking ugly. She does get good prices, so there's that at least.

Kajus doesn't live long enough to learn about the attack on the Vienna Chantry. Harrison's ghouls set him on fire before he can think to ask.
