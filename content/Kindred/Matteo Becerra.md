Matteo Becerra was a lucky kindred. That's how he viewed it. He was always able to achieve what he wanted by waiting out the opposition. He a member of an ill fated coterie in New Orleans that attacked at Sabbat Incursion. They'd been given bad information and walked into a well prepared Sabbat pack, above and beyond a standard group of shovelheads. 

It was nearly a complete massacre, but he got lucky. He managed to kill a kindred and make his escape. Now, some might say that this wasn't lucky and instead a mistake. Actually he can picture Susan saying that. Susan being his very dead coterie member. Lucky, like he said. Because of this stroke of luck, he was mercilessly hunted by the Sabbat pack. They are incredibly attached to each other via the insane practice of group blood bonding. So when he killed one, well, he earned the hatred of all.

So, you might now ask, how is it lucky? He had to flee New Orleans and couldn't trust any of his contacts there because it was very apparent that the bad information was purposeful. So instead of trying to come sniveling in to the Prince, he left. He dominated a very rambunctious pair of college kids down for summer break and traveled West. 

It was a long and slow process. Matteo, now better informed was able to pick them off slowly. If a Tremere is given enough time to prepare and enough information, they are not something that you should ever face head on. It took two more deaths by the Sabbat kindred before they figured that out. The Camarilla in Houston allowed him to stay for a night and gather supplies before politely informing him that he was a toxic asset and to get the fuck out. Ventrue are such assholes.

So he went further West and hid out in Tucson for a bit, trying to win some favor with the Anarchs there. By this point the original coterie that he'd been picking off had started embracing kine and throwing them into places he was suspected of being. Matteo was officially extended an invitation to Phoenix by the strongest baron in the region with some conditions. Matteo accepted. 

He wasn't trying to wait out the blood bond that kept him in the pyramid, but he was lucky. The Sabbat packs were not lucky and the Baron was nice enough to help him fake his death in exchange for some very nice wards. 

Matteo spent the next several decades wandering around Anarch holdings. He wasn't the only Tremere outside the Camarilla, but he was the second oldest of the four he met. 

Being captured in Minneapolis would be considered unlucky by Luke, the friend who had asked him to come there to pay off a favor, but like Susan, Luke is dead. So who won that one, huh?

Fatima was a pain, but it was only thirty years and she was delicious. Now Matteo has a weird Malk stalking him. Better than that though, now nobody's in the Pyramid. Also, there's an enormous vault of all sorts of interesting things that he wants to get his hands on.
