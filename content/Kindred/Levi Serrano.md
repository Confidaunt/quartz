Levi's never been happy living in cities. It's where he had to come to work and in the end it's where he died. The woods have always been more comfortable. There's less people to worry about, to talk with, to navigate around. 

He still visits, but it's unwelcoming now. There's things out in the wilds that didn't care about him before and don't like him now. As long as he's careful, he can dump the dead. He doesn't go out too far and he doesn't stay for too long. 

The dead don't bother him. It was a good fight in the end. But it didn't matter either. At least he doesn't have to worry about the shadows that had been following him as of late.
