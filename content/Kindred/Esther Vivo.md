Most Kindred consider Toreador artists or pretenders. Toreadors are social butterflies, debutantes, hanger-on's, and lovers. Toreadors, all kindred really, have reputations that proceed them.

Esther hates it. Everyone is their own being. Human, Kindred, Ghoul. Each is different even if they come from the exact same circumstance. Each of those circumstances are impossible to understand unless a person lives through it. Experiences may be so close as to be within a hairs breath of each other. Words help, but the gap can really only be closed by inspiring others.

Esther writes poetry. It's more complex than that. She wants to reach both kindred and kine, but to have her work be properly understood, she must shape the experiences of the kine who carry her words.

Their suffering is so close to her own, so close to her soul. Esther feels seen when they act in her stead. She is truly sharing a gift with them. Esther Vivo is loved by those who read her work. She bears her soul to them and they come so close to seeing her. Kindred are among her fans, but she doesn't care much about their esteem unless she views them as artist on a similar level to herself.

The fall of the Vienna Chantry is tragic. Esther is inspired. If there is one thing that Toreador share, it's their appreciate of beauty and the truths it can communicate. 

Marrok supported her position as Primogen of the Toreador. She's determined to look out for the best case scenario for the Kindred under her.
