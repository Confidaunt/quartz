The world is a marvel to behold. There is so much depth, so many feelings, such brilliant color. The things that Andca lost when he lost is heartbeat is something that he can never recapture. But what he gained he could have never imagined. There is nothing that can come close to the things he can now perceived in the world. 

There is so much more to his art. The colors of life, of death, of blood. Andca can loose himself in the watching, the absorbing, the recording of the world around him. It is not unusual to spend an entire night in one place, watching. When inspiration strikes him, it hits hard. He's driven to create with manic energy that doesn't release it's hold on him until it's satisfied. 

Reuben is a quiet and generous partner. He appreciates Andca's art and makes sure that it goes to the correct patrons and galleries. Reuben is a generous man who has never asked much from Andca. Their relationship is a quiet one, but comfortable and stable. 

Jacques is a sweet kid. It's really a shame that he's a Tremere as the name carries a great deal of baggage. Andca has appreciated the opportunity to explore the difference in their perception and is planning a new exhibit some time in the next couple of decade, once Jacques becomes a bit more relaxed.

The fall of the Vienna Chantry is a serious problem. The instability that now is rife throughout the Twin Cities promises nothing good. Andca wants to bear witness to at least some of what happens, but doesn't feel any attachment to anyone outside of his coterie. It really depends on what Reuben wants to do.

[[Reuben Dubois]] is his lover, his friend and a generous patron. Many kindred have a hard time finding a true friendship, but that's what Andca considers Reuben. They have a comfortable respect for each other. They've enjoyed many quiet years as they build strength and respect. The pair came to Minneapolis during the 90's after being offered prime domain by Prince [[Osmont Lamirand]].

[[Jacques Lambert]] is a relatively young Tremere. Andca has enjoyed coaxing Jacque into indulging in his interests outside of the needs pyramid. Jacque still has a ways to go before becoming more than a friendly acquaintance, but Andca trust him enough to allow his access to his private studio.

[[Nareil Sebastian]] A tightly wound kindred. She practices order like a Ventrue and respects hierarchy like the Tremere like she is. Her art is organization and with it she's a master.

[[Verity Jiang]] A Brujah happy to cause trouble. She's disloyal, but hasn't broken any of the Camarilla's laws.
