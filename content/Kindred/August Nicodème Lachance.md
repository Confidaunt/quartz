August Nicodème Lachance is the Chancellor, the record keeper of debts between Kindred. He has served in this role for more than three quarters of his existence. 

August always did as he was supposed to. He was a good and handsome young man whose upbringing always taught him to say yes to his betters. He was a brilliant student and when his teacher offered to introduce him to a scholar, well he couldn't say no. And when the scholar offered friendship, well he couldn't say no. And when that friendship grew into something more, well he couldn't say no. And when the nature of his soon-to-be sire, he was too afraid to say no. And ever after, he couldn't say no. A brick does not question it's place in the foundation no matter how it is pressed. And the world he was in built around him. More and more he became a part of the structure that enveloped him. 

Then he found himself without structure. There were no bonds holding him. He slipped downwards towards himself as an individual and found the old horror of himself. The repugnant choices he'd made. His friends, dear dead friends walked about and carried out the will that had consumed all of them. They were full only of bad memories that he was free to walk away from. So he did walk, out into the free night. The structure that was once both him and his home no longer mattered. It was of no concern to him.

August dismembers one of his dead friends, a ghoul, [[Marianna Rue]], and leaves her viscera across much of the room. A fire is started, the sprinklers kick off. Nothing useful is left.
