Good Times was a strong coterie in the Twin Cities. They were favorites of the Prince and threw most excellent parties, balls, and orgies. There was a lot of debt and favors that they held over others. When the Vienna Chantry fell and the Prince died, the new Prince was unwilling to assume the debt of his kinsman, wasn't willing to make Good Times whole, so Good Times didn't recognize his authority and has petitioned the head of the Camarilla for redress of their grievances. Is Good Times making a move for more soft power, a puppet prince, or maybe even crowning one of their own? Who's to know. For now they are watching Rome burn and sheltering ghouls in exchange for secrets. They are also treating with Anarchs.
